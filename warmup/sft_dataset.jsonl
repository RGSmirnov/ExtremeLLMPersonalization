[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nThe story of iDEATH unfolds through the eyes of the narrator, who shares the tale of the people and events that shaped this community. At the heart of the conflict lies Margaret, a former lover of the narrator, and inBOIL, a rebellious individual who has left iDEATH to live near the Forgotten Works, a massive trash heap filled with remnants of a long-lost civilization. Margaret, an enthusiast of collecting forgotten items, has a connection with inBOIL and his followers, who venture into the Forgotten Works and create their own whiskey. inBOIL's departure from the group may be linked to the tragic event of 'The Tigers', a mysterious entity that was annihilated by the people many years ago. The nature of 'The Tigers' remains unclear, as they were capable of both violence and intellectual pursuits, such as speaking, singing, and arithmetic. The last tiger was killed at a spot that would later become a trout farm, while two others met their end on a bridge known as the abandoned bridge. As the novel reaches its climax, inBOIL returns to iDEATH with a small group of followers, claiming he wants to reveal the true nature of their community. The residents are left in suspense, unsure of inBOIL's intentions, and many suspect that he may be planning to harm them. Meanwhile, Margaret appears to be unaware of the impending danger and unconcerned about the safety of her loved ones. Her alleged knowledge of inBOIL's plan and failure to reveal it has led to her being ostracized from the community. The narrator's relationship with Margaret ended due to these events, which set the stage for the story of iDEATH."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nThrough the narrator's first person account we hear the story of the people and the events of iDEATH. The central tension is created by Margaret, once a lover of the narrator, and inBOIL, a rebellious man who has left iDEATH to live near a forbidden area called the Forgotten Works. It is a huge trash heap where the remnants of a former civilization lie abandoned in great piles. Margaret, a collector of such 'forgotten things', is friendly with inBOIL and his followers, who explore the place and make whiskey. inBOIL's separation from the group may have been related to the annihilation of 'The Tigers', killed many years previously by the people. It is unknown to the reader whether 'The Tigers' were actual tigers, human beings or somehow anthropomorphic: while the tigers would kill and eat people (including the narrator's parents) they could also talk, sing, play musical instruments and were at least competent with arithmetic. Two tigers were killed on a bridge (known later as 'the abandoned bridge'). The last tiger was killed on a spot later developed into a trout farm. In the violent climax of the novel, inBOIL returns to the community along with a handful of followers, planning, he says, to show the residents what iDEATH really is. The residents know only that \"something\" is about to happen\u2014for all they know, inBOIL could be plotting to kill them all. Margaret appears oblivious to the threats, and unconcerned about the safety of her own family and friends. Many suspect that Margaret knew and did not reveal details of inBOIL's real plan, thus \"conspiring\" with the evil men. She is semi-ostracized from iDEATH, and at the beginning of the novel the narrator reveals he had ended their relationship because of these events."}]

Fit your food processor with the standard blade and place half of the potatoes and half of the onions in the processor. (Grama Stephen insists that no matter how big your food processor, batching is essential.) Pulse until the potatoes and onions are finely minced. Add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic and 2 eggs, and pulse again. Add half of the matzo meal in a circular motion covering the top of the mixture and pulse once more. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and start a second batch using the same steps 1 through 5.\n\nHeat 1 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. When the oil is hot (just before it starts to smoke), ladle 1/3 cup-sized portions into the oil and cook until the bottom side is golden brown. Once the bottom side is brown, use a fork (yes, a fork!) to gently flip over the latke. (Grama Stephen says using a fork minimizes splashing and keeps the other latkes in the pan undisturbed.) When both sides are golden brown, lift the latkes from the pan with a slotted spatula and place them on a paper towel to drain. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.

In this research, we introduce a new interactive binary image segmentation method that leverages the Markov Random Field (MRF) framework and the fast bilateral solver (FBS) technique. To develop this method, we utilize the geodesic distance component to create the unary term, and we use superpixels instead of pixels to ensure efficient computation and responsive interaction. Additionally, we employ a bilateral affinity approach for the pairwise term to preserve edge information and reduce noise. By employing an alternating direction strategy, the MRF energy minimization problem is divided into two manageable subproblems that can be solved using steepest gradient descent (SGD) and FBS respectively. Experimental results on the VGG interactive image segmentation dataset demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, and it can achieve high-quality edge-smooth segmentation results even when the foreground and background colors are difficult to distinguish."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nBinary image segmentation plays an important role in computer vision and has\nbeen widely used in many applications such as image and video editing, object\nextraction, and photo composition.

[{"role": "user", "content": " In this study, we introduce a representation learning method that is both easy to train and highly effective, achieving performance that is competitive with deep neural networks in the task of digital pathology image segmentation. This approach, referred to as sparse coding driven deep decision tree ensembles, or ScD2TE for short, offers a fresh viewpoint on representation learning. We investigate the potential of stacking multiple layers utilizing non-differentiable pairwise modules, resulting in a densely concatenated architecture that embodies the principles of feature map reuse and end-to-end dense learning. Within this framework, fast convolutional sparse coding is employed to extract multi-level features from each layer's output. This integration allows for the combination of rich image appearance models with additional contextual information through the learning of a series of decision tree ensembles. The appearance and high-level context features from all preceding layers are effectively merged by concatenating them for feed-forward input, enhancing the accuracy of subsequent layer outputs and improving the overall training efficiency of the model. Unlike deep neural networks, our ScD2TE approach does not necessitate back-propagation computations and requires fewer hyper-parameters. ScD2TE facilitates rapid end-to-end pixel-wise training in a layer-wise fashion. We validated the effectiveness of our segmentation method by testing it on a multi-disease state and multi-organ dataset, where it consistently outperformed several leading deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and fully convolutional networks (FCN)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nIn this paper, we propose an easily trained yet powerful representation\nlearning approach with performance highly competitive to deep neural networks\nin a digital pathology image segmentation task.

The price works out to less than $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent, given the proven and probable reserves of more than 170 million barrels of oil equivalent of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. \"We value other Indian oil and gas reserves at $2.90 (assuming an oil price of $18), so BG appears to have paid a good price,\" said ABN Amro in a research note.\nA Bombay-based energy analyst reckoned Enron \"probably undersold,\" noting that earlier this year Indian state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., a partner of Enron's Indian unit, had its $400 million offer for the assets rejected. \nEnron has experienced mixed success as an integrated energy operator in India, and is attempting to exit the controversial Dabhol Power Project, India's largest private power plant, in which it has a 65% controlling stake. \nThe Indian unit's assets comprise a 30% stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and gas field, and a 62.64% interest in the CB-OS/1 exploration license in the Gulf of Cambay off western India. The Enron unit is the designated operator of these developments. \nEquity production from the fields amounts to 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, representing about 6% to 7% of BG's total output. For the year ended March 31, Enron's Indian unit posted pro forma profit after tax of $60 million on revenue of $160 million. \nThe acquisition complements BG's fledgling refining and marketing interests in India, which include holdings in western Indian distributors Gujarat Gas Co. (65%) and Mahanagar Gas (50%). It is also the driving force behind a project to pipe liquefied natural gas from Iran to tap India's growing appetite for gas.\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Extreme Networks jumped 1.42, or 22%, to 7.84. Foundry Networks climbed 1.04, or 16%, to 7.37. Ciena improved 2.52, or 27%, to 12.03. All trade on the Nasdaq. \nThe gains came after Cisco's chief executive, John Chambers, told an audience at a broker-sponsored conference that the company felt comfortable with estimates for its earnings in the current quarter, which ends this month. \nThe Nasdaq Composite Index, sparked by the bulge in technology prices, shot up 88.48, or 5.93%, the index's biggest one-day improvement since the spring, and the fifth-sharpest improvement this year, as well as the 14th-best one-day advance ever. The index finished the session at 1580.81, which is just above where it closed Sept. 10, the day before the terrorists struck the U.S. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, which got a strong contribution from technology components like Microsoft and International Business Machines, climbed 173.19 points, or 1.93%. That was the ninth-sharpest one-day gain this year; the industrial average ended at 9123.78. \n\"There was a real nice tone to the market today,\" said Pat Davis, head of Nasdaq trading at UBS Warburg, said. \"But I don't think you can say we've heard all the bad news we're going to hear. \nOver the past three weeks, Wall Street analysts had been systematically reducing their earnings projections to better reflect the deterioration in economic conditions. Only over the past several days had they begun to focus on valuations, saying that, in some instances, stock prices looked attractive, even projecting weaker earnings. \nLehman Brothers, for example, jumped to the defense of some software names, and a number of those marked improvement. Shares of PeopleSoft gained 3.14, or 15%, to 23.68 on the Nasdaq, a 50% improvement over its Sept. 27 52-week low of 15.78. BMC Software added 74 cents, or 5.8%, to 13.60. \nA number of storage-products makers marked sharp improvements, after Dain Rauscher Wessels insisted high-quality names in the sector would be able to realize earnings targets. McData, for example, rose 2.11, or 26%, to 10.15, while QLogic shot up 5.89, or 33%, to 23.96, both on the Nasdaq. \nSeveral other sectors of the market, including those that have suffered most in the days since the attacks on Sept. 11, managed to mount recoveries. Shares of Delta Air Lines gained 2.27, or 8.4%, to 29.36. Continental Airlines advanced 1.93, or 11%, to 19.32. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 1.45, or 7%, to 22.12. \nShares of several insurers moved higher on the prospects of higher rates. Ace climbed 5.41, or 19%, to 34.31. Everest Re added 5.24, or 7.6%, to 73.80. XL Capital advanced 5.05, or 6.2%, to 86.45. \nNortel Networks wasn't punished for warnings that it would report a much wider loss in the third quarter than analysts had been anticipating. Nevertheless, the stock finished 25 cents higher, up 4.7%, at 5.54. \nL-3 Communications added 4.22, or 4.7%, to 93.60, reaching a 52-week high. The New York maker of defense communications products signed an agreement to acquire the Canadian aviation-services provider Spar Aerospace. \nSun Microsystems moved up 99 cents, or 12%, to 9 on the Nasdaq. The Palo Alto, Calif., networking-products developer said it received a two-year, $100 million sourcing pact from News Corp. \nQwest Communications, which slumped to a 52-week low Tuesday, gained 1.60, or 10%, to 17.20. CIBC World Markets talked up the stock, citing its valuation. \nEli Lilly fell 3.62, or 4.4%, to 79.25. The drug maker warned that sales of its blockbuster antidepressant Prozac have eroded faster than expected after it lost its patent protection two months ago. \nShares of several independent energy marketers moved higher, helped by comments from Salomon Smith Barney, which said the recent selloff in the group left the stocks at attractive valuations. Enron gained 2.88, or 9.4%, to 33.49, Dynegy added 1.66, or 4.3%, to 39.96, and Duke Energy gained 37 cents, or 0.9%, to 39.60. \nBest Buy rose 3.70, or 9.2%, to 48.80 in what proved a strong session for retail, after Credit Suisse First Boston called the Minneapolis retailer the best name in hardline consumer-electronics retailing. \nShares of some real-estate-investment trusts weakened, following skeptical comments on earnings from UBS Warburg. Boston Properties fell 1.48, or 3.9%, to 36.37, Simon Property, Indianapolis, eased 20 cents, or 0.7%, to 26.90, and Apartment Investment and Management, Denver, lost 1.56, or 3.5%, to 42.80. \nIdec Pharmaceuticals advanced 2.12, or 4.1%, to 53.74, on upbeat comments Dain Rauscher made about the drug developer.\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The company wants to focus on trading and making markets in a variety of commodities. \nIt is \"another significant step for Enron in selling assets not integrated into its wholesale or retail energy businesses,\" the company said in a written statement. \nEnron's other assets for sale in India include the controversial Dabhol Power Project, India's largest private power plant, in which Enron holds a 65 percent controlling stake. \nReports surfaced Wednesday that Enron might be willing to sell its stake in the $3 billion project at a discount. Analysts have said for months now that Enron would like to exit the project but has been unable to find a buyer willing to make the right offer. Tata Power Co., India's largest private electricity firm, has acknowledged that it has held preliminary talks over Dabhol. \nThe oil and natural gas reserves sale includes a 30 percent stake in the Tapti natural gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and natural gas field 60 miles northwest of Mumbai and a 62.6 percent interest in the offshore block CB-OS/1 exploration license. All are on the west coast of India. \nProduction from the fields is about 70 million cubic feet of gas and 8,200 barrels of oil per day. Reserves in the field are estimated to be 170 million barrels of oil equivalent. BG paid about $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent. \nThe other partners in the Tapti and Panna/Mukta offshore operations are Oil and Natural Gas Corp., which holds 40 percent, and Reliance Industries, with a 30 percent stake. The other partners in the CB-OS/1 license are Hindustan Oil Exploration Co., with 17.36 percent, Tata Petrodyne with 10 percent, and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. with 10 percent. \nEnron acquired its natural gas reserves in India with an eye to using them as fuel in the Dabhol plant. \nIn August, Houston-based Enron said it and its other foreign partners were ready to sell their stakes in Dabhol for no less than $1 billion, an amount estimated to be sufficient only to cover their costs and direct financial investment in the project. \nDabhol has been facing problems for nearly a year over high tariffs and payment defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer. It was forced to shut down its 740 megawatt plant on India's west coast in June after the board stopped buying power. \nJohn Ambler, Enron spokesman, would not comment specifically on any possible negotiations to sell the Dabhol project, but said the company favors selling its stake. \n\"We continue to believe that the quickest and best approach for solving this issue is for the government of India and/or Indian financial institutions to acquire the foreign stakeholders in the plant,\" Ambler said. \"We are continuing to pursue the legal remedies available to us under the power purchase agreement and are seeking a recovery of our costs.\" \nThe shutdown has stalled an expansion program that was almost complete and would have raised the generating capacity at the project to 2,184 megawatts. \nOther partners in Dabhol include General Electric and the Bechtel construction firm, which each own 10 percent. \nThe remaining 15 percent is held by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the nearly bankrupt power distribution monopoly in the state where the plant is located. \nBG's existing interests in India include holdings in western Indian natural gas distributors Gujarat Gas Co. and Mahanagar Gas. The company is also working on a project to move liquefied natural gas from Iran via pipeline into India. \nIndia's gas demand is projected to grow by 50 percent over the next 10 years, while its gas production is declining. \nEdison rates to remain high under utility's deal with state\nBy KAREN GAUDETTE\nAssociated Press Writer\n10/04/2001\nAssociated Press Newswires\nCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Consumer advocates warn that Southern California Edison customers, already saddled with last spring's record rate increase until 2003, could face even more rate hikes in the months ahead. \nThe deal secretly negotiated with the state Public Utilities Commission this week settles a lawsuit filed by Edison last November and is designed to keep the utility from following Pacific Gas and Electric, the state's largest utility, into bankruptcy.\nIt lets Edison pay off more than $3 billion of a $3.9 billion debt, in part by forcing ratepayers to continue paying higher rates imposed last May for at least the next two years. \nConsumer advocates, however, said Wednesday that other consequences of the state's power crisis could send rates higher still. \nThe state's power-buying agency has yet to announce exactly how much money it needs from utility customers to repay the state for the billions of dollars it has spent buying electricity this year and to pay for about $43 billion of long-term power already contracted for delivery. \nThe prospect of continuing to pay higher rates and possibly enduring even more price hikes in the future dismayed some Edison customers. \n\"We can't stay in business,\" said William Ho, general manager of Top Hat Cleaners in West Hollywood, where the monthly electric bill has gone from $600 before the state's energy crisis to nearly $1,200. \"We would have to raise prices, and we're already heading into a recession.\" \nHo said Top Hat has tried to cut back on electricity use by shutting off display lights in the windows. But he added, \"You can't press clothes in the dark.\" \nIt's unclear how much more money ratepayers will be called upon to contribute without knowing how much the state needs to pay billions of dollars in power-buying costs, said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group. \nHoge and other consumer advocates said this week's deal amounts to a ratepayer bailout of Edison, which supported the state's failed deregulation plan. \n\"It's like saying I'm not going to beat you any harder, so it shouldn't hurt,\" she said. \nJohn Bryson, Edison International president and chief executive officer, said the settlement would help the utility restore its good credit and repay its creditors. \nEdison owes nearly $4 billion to hundreds of power companies, ranging from energy marketing giant Enron Corp. to the state Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power grid. \n\"The agreement means stability, predictability,\" he said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday. \"It means preserving and enhancing the infrastructure of electricity that makes the economy of our region work.\" \nThe PUC said the agreement would help the state begin pulling away from its role as a power-buyer. Commission President Loretta Lynch said the agency had little choice in figuring a way to let Edison repay its debts and avoid bankruptcy. \n\"I think that this is a balanced compromise, but clearly it does allow ratepayers to pay off some of the back debt,\" she said. \nThe state Department of Water Resources so far has spent $9 billion buying electricity for customers of Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. \nThe shareholder-owned utilities suffered huge losses by being unable to pass along soaring wholesale power costs to their ratepayers. The state's 1996 deregulation law imposed a price cap on energy rates paid by customers. \nThat price cap was the focal point of Edison's lawsuit against the PUC, with the utility contending the state had no right to prevent the utility from passing the cost of energy to its customers. \nUnder the deal struck this week, Edison also must direct its available cash and an estimated $1.2 billion it would have issued in shareholder dividends toward paying its debt. The utility could be due refunds ordered by federal energy regulators, and that money also would have to help pay down the debt. \nThe agreement now goes before U.S. District Court Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los Angeles, who could rule on it this week. \n\"Right now Judge Lew has his hands in the pockets of ratepayers. ... Will he pull out $3.3 billion for Edison or will he protect the working men and women of California who can least afford to pay a superfluous bailout tax?\" said Douglas Heller of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which organized a protest rally Wednesday outside the federal courthouse in Los Angeles. \nHeller estimated the settlement could cost Edison ratepayers $750 each over the next four years. \n--- \nOn the Net: \nhttp://www.sce.com \nhttp://www.cpuc.ca.gov \nhttp://www.turn.org\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd\nNEW DELHI, Oct. 3. BG India has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire Enron's offshore interests in the country for a consideration of $388 million. \nThe contract signed on Tuesday night with Enron Oil and Gas India Ltd involves purchase of the latter's 30 per cent stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna-Mukta gas/oil fields besides the 62.64 per cent interest in the CB-OS/1 exploration block.\nAddressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr Nigel Shaw, BG India Chief Executive Officer, said that the sale was contingent on the other stakeholders agreeing to BG as the operator of the exploration fields. \nThe rider of approval from other stakeholders comes in the backdrop of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), a 40 per cent stakeholder in the Panna-Mukta, Tapti fields, besides a 10 per cent stake in the CB-OS/1 exploration block, seeking operatorship of the fields. \nWhen contacted, the ONGC Chairman, Mr Subir Raha, said, \"ONGC's position remains unchanged and it is still pressing for operatorship of the fields. We are currently in talks with BG on the issue.\" \n\"We are in talks with the Government as well as ONGC on the issue. We are not contemplating a situation when operatorship is denied,\" \nMr Shaw replied when queried on the issue. He stressed that in case the other parties do not agree, the deal will fall through. \"We will walk away in such an event,\" he said. \nOn the legality of ONGC's claim, Mr Shaw said, \"under the agreement, at the point of change of control (from Enron to BG), the other stakeholders can object to the transfer of operatorship (to BG). However, the contract is not clear on the deadlock.\" \nMr Shaw was hopeful that the transfer of shares would take place by the end of the month. \nCurrently, in the Tapti and Panna-Mukta gas fields, Reliance Industries Ltd holds 30 per cent stake while ONGC holds 40 per cent equity. In the case of the CB-OS/1 exploration field, Hindustan Oil and Exploration Company holds 17.36 per cent, Tata Petrodyne 10 per cent and ONGC 10 per cent. \nThe BG vision: BG plans to double the gas production capacity of the Tapti gas fields by 2004, according to Mr Shaw. Though not willing to reveal the quantum of investment in the future, he said that BG would be committed to its share in the expansion of the fields besides the exploration efforts on CB-OS/1 field where three wells are scheduled to be drilled in December. \n\"There is opportunity for significant investment in the fields and one of the frustrations has been the lack of this.\" \nBG will be honouring the present gas sale agreement with Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) which involves sale of gas at base load level for the life of the asset (exploration field). However, the venture will be free to find new markets for sale of any incremental gas recovered from the fields. Currently, the fields yield 70 million standard cu.feet of gas per day and 8,200 barrels of oil per day. \nBG has a 50 per cent stake in Mahanagar Gas Ltd, a gas supply company in Mumbai. Further, it is in the process of setting up an LNG regassification terminal in Pipavav. \nBG is not interested in buying out Enron's upcoming LNG regassification facility at Dabhol since it is setting up its own LNG regassification terminal at Pipavav, Gujarat, Mr Shaw said. \nMr Shaw said that given the vast market potential and the dwindling recovery from the domestic fields, there would not be any conflict of interest between the gas sold from the LNG terminal and that from the exploration fields. \nOn the pricing front, the Tapti and Panna-Mukta fields enjoy a fixed price contract till 2004. Beyond this period, the pricing is internationally linked. \nOnce the deal is completed, BG India plans to initiate talks with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and ONGC to second their personnel at the operating level of the exploration venture, according to Mr Shaw. \nFurther, it would minimise the involvement of its parent company in London as well as keep the number of expatriates in the joint ventures to a minimum. \nBG has so far invested $150 million in its ventures in the country. \n- Our Bureau\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Before he was nominated for the Army post by Bush, White was vice chairman of Houston-based Enron Energy Services. \n\"In the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, homeland security has emerged as a paramount national priority,\" White said. \"As the Department of Defense executive agent for homeland security, I look forward to working closely with Gov.

The assets include a 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and gas fields as well as a 62.64 per cent interest in a licence to explore the CB-OS/1 block. All three are located on the west coast of India and are operated by Enron. \nHowever, British Gas India chief executive officer Nigel Shaw said the deal is subject to the condition that British Gas gets operational control of the fields. \"If we are not the operator, we will walk away from the deal,\" he said. The deal, signed in London last night, would require clearance from the Indian government. Shaw revealed that British Gas India has already initiated a dialogue with the government for this.\nBut the deal seems to have run into a roadblock even before the ink on it has dried. The state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) which has a 40 per cent interest in the fields is expected to try for the operatorship of the oil and gas fields which were earlier operated by Enron Oil & Gas. \nHowever, petroleum minister Ram Naik said \"all issues will be sorted out in due course\". \"Enron today wrote to me to go ahead with the deal. We will examine the issue,\" he said. \nAccording to oil industry sources, the operatorship is based on a consensus_and not on the percentage of shares held_among shareholders. The proposed sale of Enron's assets does not \"mean an automatic transfer of operatorship and the shareholders will have to come to a consensus,\" ONGC sources claim. \nWhat is more, ONGC had earlier unsuccessfully bid $350 million for Enron's oil and gas assets. ONGC has the first right of refusal, according to an ONGC official. ONGC chairman S Raha was unavailable for comment. \nShaw admitted that the contract between the three existing partners does not lay down the course of action in case a deadlock emerges on the issue of operating the oil and gas fields. \n\"We are in active discussion with both ONGC and Reliance. We are hopeful of wrapping it up by the end of this month,\" Shaw said. \nAn ONGC official, however, said the state-owned company was aware of the development but had not been informed officially by Enron. \nShaw also disclosed that British Gas was willing to make further investments to ramp up production at the Tapti and the Panna/Mukta fields. \n\"Further investments have not happened as the partners could not agree. We are looking at the possibility of doubling production by 2004,\" he said. \nWhen asked what would be the investment required for such an exercise, Shaw said that it would run into hundreds of millions of dollars. \nThe three oil and gas fields together produce around 300 million cubic meters of gas and 29,000 barrels of oil a day. \nAn Enron spokesman refused to comment on the issue of operatorship as did a Reliance spokesman. \nEnron Oil & Gas has 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas and Panna/Mukta oil and gas field, ONGC has a 40 per cent interest and Reliance has the remaining 30 per cent. \nIn the case of CB-OS/1, the other partners are Hindustan Oil Exploration Company with 17.36 per cent and Tata Petrodyne and ONGC with 10 per cent each.\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Fasto=\nw, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =\nprice again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=\n energy-trading companies.=20\nInvestors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=\ning effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=\nh annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=\non, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=\nraded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=\nion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =\nthe energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=\nactions.\n\"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,\" said Merrill Lynch an=\nalyst Donato Eassey. \"There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=\nOnline.\" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =\nwhich the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =\noperations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=\ntently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20\nEnron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=\nold head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=\n intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=\nh the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=\ning concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=\nted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=\ntions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=\nssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=\nps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=\n of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=\n analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=\ncurities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=\nctions.=20\nWhile Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=\n the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=\ngements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. \"In my continue=\nd discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=\noring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Ch=\nairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20\nEnron said Mr. Fastow \"will be on a leave of absence from the company.\" He =\ncouldn't be reached for comment.=20\nIt remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=\ningly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=\n close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =\n4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=\n16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=\narly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=\ne stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=\n, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =\nstock.=20\nEnron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =\nthis year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20\nIn an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=\n which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=\nynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=\nber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=\nh different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=\ned investment vehicles.=20\nPrudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=\n be seen as evidence that \"management does care\" about investor concerns. H=\nowever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=\ns it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as \"an admissi=\non of guilt.\" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=\ngely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=\nal structure.=20\nEnron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=\n.=20\nWorries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=\ntock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =\npeople voice concerns about a possible \"death spiral\" in which increasing c=\nredit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=\no business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=\nad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =\nhas a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=\nce of such a problem.=20\nHowever, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=\n its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=\nntities. Enron is facing a problem with \"trust and credibility. It's not ea=\nsy to regain something as basic as trust,\" he said.\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Looks at Dealings\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\n10/25/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 2, Column 5\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\nThe Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=\nidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=\nse involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=\ny of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20\n''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=\n to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =\nas C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =\na statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=\nvestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=\n the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''\nThe company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =\nnamed his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=\ns group and a former corporate treasurer.=20\nEnron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=\n=20\nThe move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=\nere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=\nnce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=\n reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=\nth partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=\ns news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=\nllowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=\n write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=\nen they later learned about it.=20\nOn Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=\nlysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=\n transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=\n Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=\nls of the transactions.=20\nThe fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=\n disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=\n.=20\nBy structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =\nstock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=\not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=\n that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =\nS.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=\no address.=20\nConcerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=\n complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=\nf its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=\nn cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=\nd investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=\ndity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=\nere more than adequate.=20\nMr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=\nhe former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=\nsiness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=\nrgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=\nock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20\nAccording to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=\n successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=\ns the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=\nr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=\nhon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20\nShares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=\nce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=\ng, they fell to $16.14.=20\nOne of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=\n Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=\n from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=\nay.=20\n''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=\nday evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=\n a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=\n little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=\n=20\nBut she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=\nld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=\nt any answers.''\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The com=\npany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=\none anything improper.=20\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =\nto me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=\ns CFO,\" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =\nmarket closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20\nEnron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=\n, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=\ner earnings on Oct 16.=20\nThe earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=\nsts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=\nn's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=\n LJM2 Co-Investment.=20\nThe partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=\n served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20\nBut Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =\nEnron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20\nSo Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=\nnded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=\non took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=\n billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20\nTuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=\nllowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=\n in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a \"Chinese wall\" existed be=\ntween Enron and LJM.=20\nFastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=\ne moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=\nhe company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=\n asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=\nle with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20\nEnron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=\nor comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=\n a salary.=20\nEnron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an \"=\ninformal inquiry\" into the LJM dealings.=20\nThe news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =\nconfidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=\nr and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=\nling in August for personal reasons.=20\nA continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=\nd the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20\nWall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=\nncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=\n analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20\nBeyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=\nrships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =\nissue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=\nes.=20\nInvestors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=\nutstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=\n be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=\n=20\nIn the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower.

Enron disclosed the loss during an October=\n 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =\ncharge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=\n partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20\nAnalysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=\nonfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=\nchange Commission.=20\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =\nto me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=\ns CFO,\" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =\nEnron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=\ner served as Enron's treasurer.=20\nAnalysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=\n Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=\nstrating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=\nr Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =\ncalls.=20\nMs Coale issued a \"sell\" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=\n to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. \"We are concerned abou=\nt what we don't know,\" Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=\nve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=\nced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=\ntomers to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20\nEnron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove t=\nhe company has done nothing wrong.

McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued\nby Houston-based Enron during the summer.\n ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy\nFastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people\nare about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent\nconference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in\nterms of calming investors' concerns.''\n ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has\ngot this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,\nand he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is\nrealizing just how concerned investors are.''\n ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that\nit could extend. You never know what could come of that.''\n ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with\nthe SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset\nwrite-downs.''\n ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of\ndisclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third\nquarter.''\n ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet\nwith your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and\nthat was meant to begin in the third quarter.''\n ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-\ndowns and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all\nthese vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''\n ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of\nquestions.''\n ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of\na process where they're going to address and clean up their\nbalance sheet and they've started to replace management.''\n ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate\nbonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another\nnasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''\n ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted\nto know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to\njunk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could\nexist as a junk company.''\n ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You\nwant to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''\n ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have\nto reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''\n--Christine Harper in the London newsroom (44 20) 7330-7982 or\ncharper@bloomberg.net /jom\nEnron ousts CFO amid partnership questions\nBy PAM EASTON\nAssociated Press Writer\n10/25/2001\nAssociated Press Newswires\nCopyright 2001.

As details of this dea=\nl, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=\nsed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20\nWednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=\n once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =\nonce-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=\nale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=\nastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =\nformerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20\nHow might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=\nlleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=\n show that the \"Fastow era\" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=\nous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=\n about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =\nFastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=\ny making a lot of money from LJM2.=20\nClearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=\nn. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=\nt of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20\nNot much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=\nk massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=\n difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=\ning. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=\ner words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=\nrther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=\nhe company?=20\nThe spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=\n Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=\nessary to rebuild investor confidence.=20\nEnron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=\nowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=\nsiness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=\nion and without the knowledge of the board.=20\nIn fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=\nhe LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=\nband business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=\nrom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=\n that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=\nss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=\nhe downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=\nsponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=\n not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20\nLay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =\nArguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=\n on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =\nhas risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=\nnhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =\nspokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=\narency.=20\nAny efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=\nr people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20\nPhew!

Director=\ns have not had the scrutiny they deserve,\" said Ms. Minow, who said the ser=\nvice will be called Board Analyst. ?Planned as an added feature on an exist=\ning Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing st=\nages but is expected to launch next year, she said. ?Only directors of U.S.=\n companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added lat=\ner. ?Ms. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corpo=\nrate governance and shareholder rights.

I definitely think there wou=\nld be interest in more information on individual directors,\" said Ann Yerge=\nr, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents=\n America's large pension funds. ?The corporate governance movement, since i=\nts beginnings in the 1970s, has focused on making directors more accountabl=\ne and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside =\ndirectors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples=\n of lax board oversight still abound. ?One example would be Enron Corp., wh=\nose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities =\nand Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain ou=\ntside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Ms. Minow sai=\nd. ?\"Where was the Enron board in all of this?\" she asked. \"Boards and outs=\nide consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That=\n apparently didn't happen here.\" ?Taking the corporate governance argument =\na step further, Ms. Minow argued that effective board membership is more th=\nan a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate =\nwhen they consider buying stock in a company. ?\"This isn't just a corporate=\n governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,\" she said. ?Institu=\ntional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stoc=\nks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open=\n question. ?\"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long =\ntime and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,\" said Pet=\ner Gleason, vice-president of research and development at the National Asso=\nciation of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate =\ndirectors. ?Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate direc=\ntors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. \"More and more di=\nrectors are saying this is something we should be doing,\" Mr. Gleason said.=\n??Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Houston, Oct. =\n24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. executives?profited from inside knowledge whe=\nn they sold $73 million in?shares ahead of a 26 percent drop in the energy =\ntrading company's?stock in February and March, a shareholder alleges in a l=\nawsuit.?? The allegations of insider trading were filed today as an?ame=\nndment to an earlier lawsuit filed by shareholder Fred?Greenberg.?? The=\n original lawsuit, filed on Oct. 17 in Houston, accuses?Enron's board of co=\nsting the company at least $35 million through?dealings with two partnershi=\nps run by former Chief Financial?officer Andrew Fastow.?? In the amendm=\nent filed today, the suit accuses Fastow of?using insider knowledge that En=\nron's stock was going to drop to?prevent losses at one of the partnerships,=\n LJM2.?? The partnership was committed to buying Enron stock at?predete=\nrmined price in September 2000, the complaint says. Enron?agreed to renegot=\niate the terms of the transaction to let LJM2 buy?the shares two months ear=\nly.?? That let the partnership earn a $10.5 million in profit, the?suit =\nsays. If the transaction had not been renegotiated, the?partnership would h=\nave lost $8 for every share it sold in?September, the suit alleges.?? =\n `Bailed Out'?? ``Mr. Fastow and LJM2 took advantag=\ne of inside information to?reap illicit insider trading profits, in the mil=\nlions of dollars?in this transaction alone,'' the suit says.?? At the s=\name time that the LJM2 transaction was being?renegotiated in December and J=\nanuary, Chief Executive Officer?Kenneth Lay, President Mark Frevert and oth=\ner top managers sold?the $73 million in shares, the suit alleges.?? Enr=\non executives ``bailed out of shares... reaping huge?insider trading profit=\ns,'' the lawsuit says.?? Other sellers included former CEO Jeff Skillin=\ng, Chief?Strategy Officer Cliff Baxter, broadband services CEO Ken Rice,?Ch=\nief of Staff Steve Kean, pipeline group CEO Stanley Horton and?Chief Risk O=\nfficer Richard Buy, the suit says.?? Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne decl=\nined to comment on the?lawsuit.?? ``We haven't been served (notice of t=\nhe suit), and it's our?policy not to talk about pending litigation,'' she s=\naid?? In March, spokesman Mark Palmer said the executives exercised?sto=\nck options that would have expired worthless otherwise.?? Enron has for=\nmed at least 18 affiliated companies to buy and?sell company assets, accord=\ning to records from the Texas secretary?of state. The Houston-based company=\n reported $1.01 billion in?third-quarter losses, including $35 million from=\n the LJM?partnerships run by Fastow.?? SEC Inqui=\nry?? Greenberg says directors shouldn't have allowed Fastow to run?part=\nnerships that bought and sold company assets.?? Shares of Enron have fa=\nllen 52 percent in the past six days?on investor concern about the liabilit=\nies attached to partnerships?and affiliated companies formed by Enron to re=\nmove debt from its?books. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is lo=\noking into?the partnerships.??

(Adds description of Enron Net Works in sixth paragra=\nph.)?? Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief?Financi=\nal Officer Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange?Commission inquiry =\ninto partnerships he ran that cost the largest?energy trader $35 million.??=\n Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets?group, as CFO=\n because ``it became clear to me that restoring?investor confidence would r=\nequire us to replace Andy,'' Chairman?and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth L=\nay said in a statement.?Fastow will take a leave of absence.?? Shares o=\nf Enron, based in Houston, have fallen 80 percent?this year. Third-quarter =\nlosses of $1.01 billion from failed?investments outside the main commoditie=\ns trading business wiped?out 70 percent of the profit earned in the past fo=\nur quarters.?? ``Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure t=\no?Andy,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded?Enron to `=\n`long-term buy'' today and owns no shares.?? As Enron treasurer, McMaho=\nn complained to then-Enron?President Jeffrey Skilling about potential confl=\nicts of interest?posed by the Fastow partnerships in 1999, the Wall Street =\nJournal?reported yesterday. Rebuffed, McMahon secured a reassignment, the?J=\nournal said, citing people familiar with the matter.?? ``McMahon was ma=\nde famous under Skilling by going to him and?objecting to the partnerships,=\n'' Feygin said. ``For that, he was?transferred out of the treasurer functio=\nn into Enron Net Works,''?which oversees Enron's Internet trading system.??=\n `An Outstanding Job'?? Fastow, 39 years old, ran=\n LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,?two partnerships created by Enron to bu=\ny company assets. Enron's?involvement in the financing vehicles cost the co=\nmpany $35 million?in third-quarter losses. Enron also bought back 62 millio=\nn shares?from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment.?? =\n On a conference call yesterday, Lay said that ``I and Enron's?board of di=\nrectors continue to have the highest faith and?confidence in Andy and think=\n he's doing an outstanding job as?CFO.''?? Enron announced that Fastow=\n would leave after its stock?closed down $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41 in=\n today's trading.?? The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships=\n Monday.?Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron?=\nis cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received.?? The co=\nmpany has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships?and corporations, some=\n of which buy and sell Enron assets such as?power plants, records at the Te=\nxas secretary of state's office?indicate.?? The Texas records list doze=\nns of Enron executives as officers?and directors of company-related partner=\nships. None of them have?any financial interest in the partnerships after F=\nastow severed?ties to the LJM partnerships in July, Palmer said.?? =\n `Zero Compensation'?? ``The managers in these affiliates=\n listed as managing members?are representational in nature only,'' he said.=\n ``They get zero?compensation.''?? The LJM partnerships were different.=\n Enron's board allowed?Fastow, who has worked for the company for 11 years,=\n to run them?and earn as much as 2 percent annually on the amounts invested=\n,?the Wall Street Journal reported last week. A lawsuit filed by a?sharehol=\nder objecting to the arrangement said the partnerships?reworked an agreemen=\nt with Enron to avoid taking big losses.?? Enron is obligated to repay =\n$3.3 billion associated with two?other partnerships, Marlin and Whitewing, =\nif they can't raise?enough money from asset sales to pay off the balance, E=\nnron?spokesman Mark Palmer said. Palmer said ``maybe, maybe not'' when?aske=\nd if the partnerships will generate enough cash.?? ``The concern now is=\nn't just with the LJM partnership, it's?more with the other partnerships, s=\nuch as Osprey and Marlin,''?said A.G. Edwards analyst Mike Heim, who has a =\n``hold'' rating on?Enron and owns no shares.?? High L=\nevel Departures?? Enron has lost several senior executives in the past =\ntwo?years. CEO Skilling resigned in August after seven months on the?job, c=\niting personal reasons and frustration with declines in the?company's stock=\n price. Enron Corp. Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton?left the company in Nove=\nmber as the company switched its focus?from developing assets to energy and=\n commodity trading.?? Rebecca Mark, one of the highest-ranking women in=\n U.S.?business, quit August 2000 as chairman and chief executive of?Azurix =\nCorp., a water company formed by Enron Corp. Mark also?resigned from Enron'=\ns board.?? Azurix was a money-losing investment. Enron sold shares in?t=\nhe water company to the public that it later had to buy back.??--Russell Hu=\nbbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651??"}]

Then, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Add 2 medium onions, diced, and 5 medium garlic cloves, crushed (or 4 teaspoons of chopped garlic from a jar) to the pot. Cook the onions and garlic until they're lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of salt over the top to bring out their flavors.\n\nNext, add 2-3 peeled and chopped carrots (or 15-20 baby carrots) to the pot, along with 2 sliced celery ribs. Cook the vegetables for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they're tender. Now it's time to add the ham: use 1 slice of baked ham (sold in a vacuum pack as \"ham steak\" or leftover from a previous meal) and break it into large chunks. Add the ham to the pot and stir to combine.\n\nPour in 10 cups of chicken broth (or up to half of it with water) and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook for 2-3 hours, or until the soup has thickened and the flavors have melded together. About an hour into cooking, use tongs to pull out the ham and chop it into bite-sized pieces or snip it with kitchen scissors right over the pot.\n\nFinally, taste the soup for seasoning and adjust as needed. You may want to add a bay leaf (optional) or a pinch of thyme (optional) to give it an extra boost of flavor. If you like, blend some or all of the soup with a regular blender (more trouble) or an immersion blender (zero trouble) to create a smooth and creamy texture."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " Reporters covering the trial of singer Michael Jackson in California have requested access to the questionnaires filled out by potential jurors. Lawyers representing news organizations stated that it was \"extremely important\" for the responses of 250 prospective jurors to be made public \"to serve as a check on the process.\" The Santa Barbara County Superior Court is set to review the request on Monday. Mr. Jackson denies the allegations of child molestation. It is estimated that his trial will cost Santa Barbara County up to $4 million (\u00a32.13 million).\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Jackson's mother has expressed that she is \"100% certain\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently in the process of selecting 12 jurors and eight standby jurors for the trial, a procedure delayed until at least Thursday due to a member of the star's legal team being affected by family illness. Defense attorneys opposed the request by Associated Press and other news organizations to make potential jurors' responses public.\n\n\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires serves no purpose other than to contribute to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\" a motion from Mr. Jackson's lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5 million (\u00a31.33 million) to $4 million (\u00a32.13 million) of local taxpayers' money. These estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court, or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (\u00a321,000) per day, according to Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrator's office.\n\nMr. Jackson, 46, denies allegations of providing alcohol to a boy and molesting him. His mother, Katherine Jackson, told U.S. TV network Fox News on Sunday that her son insisted he was innocent. \"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\" she said. \"He loves children. You don't molest anything that you love.\" Describing Mr. Jackson as \"a good person,\" the mother of nine expressed her fears that he would not receive a fair trial. \"I can't sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\" she said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nR\u200be\u200bp\u200bo\u200br\u200bt\u200be\u200br\u200bs\u200b

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nThe story revolves around Norman Moonblom, a reclusive, artistic man in his thirties who has recently ended a career as a perpetual student. He is now reluctantly employed by his brother Irwin as a property agent. Irwin's tenants occupy a series of dilapidated apartments in some of the poorer areas of Manhattan, and Norman's life consists of attempting to collect their rent while constantly making them empty promises about much-needed repairs. At first, Moonblom resolves to insulate himself against his troublesome tenants, with their incessant complaining and idiosyncratic ways. However, little by little, his defenses begin to crumble as they talk to him, argue with him, and impart their secrets and hopes to him. These unprecedented intimacies bring on a seismic shift in Norman's personality, eventually inspiring him to defy his brother (who wants the apartments left exactly as they are) by undertaking all the promised repairs himself. As he goes from apartment to apartment, painting, plastering, and further immersing himself in his tenants' lives, the meek little rent collector finally comes to life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n\u0422h\u0435 st\u043er\u0443 d\u043e\u0441um\u0435nts th\u0435 \u0435m\u043et\u0456\u043en\u0430l \u0430w\u0430k\u0435n\u0456ng \u043ef \u039d\u043erm\u0430n \u041c\u043e\u043enbl\u043e\u043em, \u0430n \u0456s\u043el\u0430t\u0435d, \u0430\u0440\u0430th\u0435t\u0456\u0441 m\u0430n \u0456n h\u0456s th\u0456rt\u0456\u0435s wh\u043e, h\u0430v\u0456ng r\u0435\u0441\u0435ntl\u0443 \u0435nd\u0435d \u0430 \u0441\u0430r\u0435\u0435r \u0430s '\u0440\u0435r\u0440\u0435tu\u0430l stud\u0435nt', \u0456s n\u043ew r\u0435lu\u0441t\u0430ntl\u0443 \u0456n th\u0435 \u0435m\u0440l\u043e\u0443 \u043ef h\u0456s br\u043eth\u0435r \u0399rw\u0456n \u0430s \u0430 \u0440r\u043e\u0440\u0435rt\u0443 \u0430g\u0435nt. \u0399rw\u0456n's t\u0435n\u0430nts \u043e\u0441\u0441u\u0440\u0443 \u0430 s\u0435r\u0456\u0435s \u043ef d\u0456l\u0430\u0440\u0456d\u0430t\u0435d \u0430\u0440\u0430rtm\u0435nts \u0456n s\u043em\u0435 \u043ef th\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u043er\u0435r \u0430r\u0435\u0430s \u043ef \u039c\u0430nh\u0430tt\u0430n, \u0430nd \u039d\u043erm\u0430n's l\u0456f\u0435 \u0441\u043ens\u0456sts \u043ef \u0430tt\u0435m\u0440t\u0456ng t\u043e \u0441\u043ell\u0435\u0441t th\u0435\u0456r r\u0435nt wh\u0456l\u0435 \u0441\u043enst\u0430ntl\u0443 m\u0430k\u0456ng th\u0435m \u0435m\u0440t\u0443 \u0440r\u043em\u0456s\u0435s \u0430b\u043eut mu\u0441h-n\u0435\u0435d\u0435d r\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0456rs. \u0391t f\u0456rst, \u039c\u043e\u043enbl\u043e\u043em r\u0435s\u043elut\u0435l\u0443 \u0456nsul\u0430t\u0435s h\u0456ms\u0435lf \u0430g\u0430\u0456nst h\u0456s tr\u043eubl\u0435s\u043em\u0435 t\u0435n\u0430nts, w\u0456th th\u0435\u0456r \u0456n\u0441\u0435ss\u0430nt \u0441\u043em\u0440l\u0430\u0456n\u0456ng \u0430nd \u0456d\u0456\u043es\u0443n\u0441r\u0430t\u0456\u0441 w\u0430\u0443s.

We anticipate that the deal will be completed after receiving approvals from shareholders and regulatory bodies, along with meeting various closing conditions.  \nDespite Enron's commitment to this agreement, U.S. and international antitrust regulations mandate that Enron and Dynegy must continue to function independently. Specifically, if Enron and Dynegy compete in certain sectors or markets, their operations must be conducted at arm's length until the merger is finalized. Consequently, for antitrust reasons, you should regard Dynegy as you would any other independent entity, regardless of the merger agreement.  \nFurthermore, all information, documents, and communications pertaining to the merger between Enron and Dynegy must be managed and authorized by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls, or Greg Whalley from Enron. It is crucial that this protocol is strictly followed. If any information needs to be shared with Dynegy as stipulated in the merger agreement, such disclosure must receive approval from one of the aforementioned individuals.  \nShould you have any inquiries regarding this notice, please reach out to Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544), or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.\nEven though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.\nIn addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nIn the celestial realm, an unyielding angel, unpursued, traversed the vast expanse of Heaven's champain until the dawn broke. The morning light, awakened by the circling hours, unbarred the gates of illumination, revealing a cave within the mount of God, where light and darkness engaged in an eternal dance. This perpetual cycle of light and darkness created a sense of grateful vicissitude, akin to the ebb and flow of day and night.\n\nAs the morning sun ascended, its golden rays illuminated the plain, and the armies of Heaven, arrayed in shining armor, clashed with the forces of darkness. The sound of war echoed through the skies, and the angel Michael, a stalwart warrior, beheld the conflict with a sense of familiarity, for he had already anticipated this outcome.\n\nWith a heart full of joy and a spirit of triumph, Michael joined the fray, and his comrades welcomed him with acclamations, for he was the one who had returned unscathed from the battle, a testament to his unwavering courage. The angelic host, led by Michael and Gabriel, marched forth to engage the enemy, their ranks unbroken and their spirits unshaken.\n\nAs the battle raged on, the angel Abdiel, a stalwart warrior, confronted the apostate angel, Satan, who had risen in rebellion against the throne of God. Abdiel, undaunted by the prospect of facing his former comrade, stood firm in his resolve, for he knew that the cause of truth was just and that he had been chosen to uphold it.\n\nThe two angels clashed, their swords flashing in the sunlight, and the outcome of the battle hung in the balance. But in the end, it was Abdiel who emerged victorious, his sword striking true and dealing a mortal blow to Satan's pride. The apostate angel fell, his armor stained with the blood of his own hubris, and the angelic host, emboldened by Abdiel's triumph, pressed on with renewed vigor.\n\nAs the battle reached its climax, the angel Michael, with his sword in hand, confronted the apostate angel, Satan, who had rallied his forces and stood defiant in the face of defeat. But Michael, undaunted by the prospect of facing his former comrade, charged forward with a fierce cry, his sword flashing in the sunlight.\n\nThe two angels clashed, their swords meeting in a shower of sparks, and the outcome of the battle hung in the balance. But in the end, it was Michael who emerged victorious, his sword striking true and dealing a mortal blow to Satan's pride.

There is a cave\nWithin the mount of God, fast by his throne,\nWhere light and darkness in perpetual round\nLodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven\nGrateful vicissitude, like day and night;\nLight issues forth, and at the other door\nObsequious darkness enters, till her hour\nTo veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well\nSeem twilight here: And now went forth the Morn\nSuch as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold\nEmpyreal; from before her vanished Night,\nShot through with orient beams; when all the plain\nCovered with thick embattled squadrons bright,\nChariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,\nReflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:\nWar he perceived, war in procinct; and found\nAlready known what he for news had thought\nTo have reported: Gladly then he mixed\nAmong those friendly Powers, who him received\nWith joy and acclamations loud, that one,\nThat of so many myriads fallen, yet one\nReturned not lost. On to the sacred hill\nThey led him high applauded, and present\nBefore the seat supreme; from whence a voice,\nFrom midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.\nServant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought\nThe better fight, who single hast maintained\nAgainst revolted multitudes the cause\nOf truth, in word mightier than they in arms;\nAnd for the testimony of truth hast borne\nUniversal reproach, far worse to bear\nThan violence; for this was all thy care\nTo stand approved in sight of God, though worlds\nJudged thee perverse: The easier conquest now\nRemains thee, aided by this host of friends,\nBack on thy foes more glorious to return,\nThan scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue\nBy force, who reason for their law refuse,\nRight reason for their law, and for their King\nMessiah, who by right of merit reigns.\nGo, Michael, of celestial armies prince,\nAnd thou, in military prowess next,\nGabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons\nInvincible; lead forth my armed Saints,\nBy thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,\nEqual in number to that Godless crew\nRebellious: Them with fire and hostile arms\nFearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven\nPursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,\nInto their place of punishment, the gulf\nOf Tartarus, which ready opens wide\nHis fiery Chaos to receive their fall.\nSo spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began\nTo darken all the hill, and smoke to roll\nIn dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign\nOf wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud\nEthereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow:\nAt which command the Powers militant,\nThat stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined\nOf union irresistible, moved on\nIn silence their bright legions, to the sound\nOf instrumental harmony, that breathed\nHeroick ardour to adventurous deeds\nUnder their God-like leaders, in the cause\nOf God and his Messiah. On they move\nIndissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,\nNor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides\nTheir perfect ranks; for high above the ground\nTheir march was, and the passive air upbore\nTheir nimble tread; as when the total kind\nOf birds, in orderly array on wing,\nCame summoned over Eden to receive\nTheir names of thee; so over many a tract\nOf Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,\nTenfold the length of this terrene: At last,\nFar in the horizon to the north appeared\nFrom skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched\nIn battailous aspect, and nearer view\nBristled with upright beams innumerable\nOf rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields\nVarious, with boastful argument portrayed,\nThe banded Powers of Satan hasting on\nWith furious expedition; for they weened\nThat self-same day, by fight or by surprise,\nTo win the mount of God, and on his throne\nTo set the Envier of his state, the proud\nAspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain\nIn the mid way: Though strange to us it seemed\nAt first, that Angel should with Angel war,\nAnd in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet\nSo oft in festivals of joy and love\nUnanimous, as sons of one great Sire,\nHymning the Eternal Father: But the shout\nOf battle now began, and rushing sound\nOf onset ended soon each milder thought.\nHigh in the midst, exalted as a God,\nThe Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,\nIdol of majesty divine, enclosed\nWith flaming Cherubim, and golden shields;\nThen lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now\n\"twixt host and host but narrow space was left,\nA dreadful interval, and front to front\nPresented stood in terrible array\nOf hideous length: Before the cloudy van,\nOn the rough edge of battle ere it joined,\nSatan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,\nCame towering, armed in adamant and gold;\nAbdiel that sight endured not, where he stood\nAmong the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,\nAnd thus his own undaunted heart explores.\nO Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest\nShould yet remain, where faith and realty\nRemain not: Wherefore should not strength and might\nThere fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove\nWhere boldest, though to fight unconquerable?\nHis puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid,\nI mean to try, whose reason I have tried\nUnsound and false; nor is it aught but just,\nThat he, who in debate of truth hath won,\nShould win in arms, in both disputes alike\nVictor; though brutish that contest and foul,\nWhen reason hath to deal with force, yet so\nMost reason is that reason overcome.\nSo pondering, and from his armed peers\nForth stepping opposite, half-way he met\nHis daring foe, at this prevention more\nIncensed, and thus securely him defied.\nProud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached\nThe highth of thy aspiring unopposed,\nThe throne of God unguarded, and his side\nAbandoned, at the terrour of thy power\nOr potent tongue: Fool!not to think how vain\nAgainst the Omnipotent to rise in arms;\nWho out of smallest things could, without end,\nHave raised incessant armies to defeat\nThy folly; or with solitary hand\nReaching beyond all limit, at one blow,\nUnaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed\nThy legions under darkness: But thou seest\nAll are not of thy train; there be, who faith\nPrefer, and piety to God, though then\nTo thee not visible, when I alone\nSeemed in thy world erroneous to dissent\nFrom all: My sect thou seest;now learn too late\nHow few sometimes may know, when thousands err.\nWhom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,\nThus answered. Ill for thee, but in wished hour\nOf my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest\nFrom flight, seditious Angel! to receive\nThy merited reward, the first assay\nOf this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,\nInspired with contradiction, durst oppose\nA third part of the Gods, in synod met\nTheir deities to assert; who, while they feel\nVigour divine within them, can allow\nOmnipotence to none. But well thou comest\nBefore thy fellows, ambitious to win\nFrom me some plume, that thy success may show\nDestruction to the rest: This pause between,\n(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know,\nAt first I thought that Liberty and Heaven\nTo heavenly souls had been all one; but now\nI see that most through sloth had rather serve,\nMinistring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!\nSuch hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven,\nServility with freedom to contend,\nAs both their deeds compared this day shall prove.\nTo whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.\nApostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find\nOf erring, from the path of truth remote:\nUnjustly thou depravest it with the name\nOf servitude, to serve whom God ordains,\nOr Nature: God and Nature bid the same,\nWhen he who rules is worthiest, and excels\nThem whom he governs. This is servitude,\nTo serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled\nAgainst his worthier, as thine now serve thee,\nThyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;\nYet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.\nReign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve\nIn Heaven God ever blest, and his divine\nBehests obey, worthiest to be obeyed;\nYet chains in Hell, not realms, expect: Mean while\nFrom me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,\nThis greeting on thy impious crest receive.\nSo saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,\nWhich hung not, but so swift with tempest fell\nOn the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,\nNor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,\nSuch ruin intercept: Ten paces huge\nHe back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee\nHis massy spear upstaid; as if on earth\nWinds under ground, or waters forcing way,\nSidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,\nHalf sunk with all his pines. Amazement seised\nThe rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see\nThus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,\nPresage of victory, and fierce desire\nOf battle: Whereat Michael bid sound\nThe Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven\nIt sounded, and the faithful armies rung\nHosanna to the Highest: Nor stood at gaze\nThe adverse legions, nor less hideous joined\nThe horrid shock. Now storming fury rose,\nAnd clamour such as heard in Heaven till now\nWas never; arms on armour clashing brayed\nHorrible discord, and the madding wheels\nOf brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise\nOf conflict; over head the dismal hiss\nOf fiery darts in flaming vollies flew,\nAnd flying vaulted either host with fire.\nSo under fiery cope together rushed\nBoth battles main, with ruinous assault\nAnd inextinguishable rage. All Heaven\nResounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth\nHad to her center shook. What wonder? when\nMillions of fierce encountering Angels fought\nOn either side, the least of whom could wield\nThese elements, and arm him with the force\nOf all their regions: How much more of power\nArmy against army numberless to raise\nDreadful combustion warring, and disturb,\nThough not destroy, their happy native seat;\nHad not the Eternal King Omnipotent,\nFrom his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled\nAnd limited their might; though numbered such\nAs each divided legion might have seemed\nA numerous host; in strength each armed hand\nA legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed\nEach warriour single as in chief, expert\nWhen to advance, or stand, or turn the sway\nOf battle, open when, and when to close\nThe ridges of grim war: No thought of flight,\nNone of retreat, no unbecoming deed\nThat argued fear; each on himself relied,\nAs only in his arm the moment lay\nOf victory: Deeds of eternal fame\nWere done, but infinite; for wide was spread\nThat war and various; sometimes on firm ground\nA standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,\nTormented all the air; all air seemed then\nConflicting fire. Long time in even scale\nThe battle hung; till Satan, who that day\nProdigious power had shown, and met in arms\nNo equal, ranging through the dire attack\nOf fighting Seraphim confused, at length\nSaw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled\nSquadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway\nBrandished aloft, the horrid edge came down\nWide-wasting; such destruction to withstand\nHe hasted, and opposed the rocky orb\nOf tenfold adamant, his ample shield,\nA vast circumference. At his approach\nThe great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil\nSurceased, and glad, as hoping here to end\nIntestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued\nOr captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown\nAnd visage all inflamed first thus began.\nAuthor of evil, unknown till thy revolt,\nUnnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest\nThese acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,\nThough heaviest by just measure on thyself,\nAnd thy adherents: How hast thou disturbed\nHeaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought\nMisery, uncreated till the crime\nOf thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled\nThy malice into thousands, once upright\nAnd faithful, now proved false! But think not here\nTo trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out\nFrom all her confines. Heaven, the seat of bliss,\nBrooks not the works of violence and war.\nHence then, and evil go with thee along,\nThy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;\nThou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils,\nEre this avenging sword begin thy doom,\nOr some more sudden vengeance, winged from God,\nPrecipitate thee with augmented pain.\nSo spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus\nThe Adversary. Nor think thou with wind\nOf aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds\nThou canst not. Hast thou turned the least of these\nTo flight, or if to fall, but that they rise\nUnvanquished, easier to transact with me\nThat thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats\nTo chase me hence? err not, that so shall end\nThe strife which thou callest evil, but we style\nThe strife of glory; which we mean to win,\nOr turn this Heaven itself into the Hell\nThou fablest; here however to dwell free,\nIf not to reign: Mean while thy utmost force,\nAnd join him named Almighty to thy aid,\nI fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.\nThey ended parle, and both addressed for fight\nUnspeakable; for who, though with the tongue\nOf Angels, can relate, or to what things\nLiken on earth conspicuous, that may lift\nHuman imagination to such highth\nOf Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed,\nStood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,\nFit to decide the empire of great Heaven.\nNow waved their fiery swords, and in the air\nMade horrid circles; two broad suns their shields\nBlazed opposite, while Expectation stood\nIn horrour: From each hand with speed retired,\nWhere erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng,\nAnd left large field, unsafe within the wind\nOf such commotion; such as, to set forth\nGreat things by small, if, nature's concord broke,\nAmong the constellations war were sprung,\nTwo planets, rushing from aspect malign\nOf fiercest opposition, in mid sky\nShould combat, and their jarring spheres confound.\nTogether both with next to almighty arm\nUp-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed\nThat might determine, and not need repeat,\nAs not of power at once; nor odds appeared\nIn might or swift prevention: But the sword\nOf Michael from the armoury of God\nWas given him tempered so, that neither keen\nNor solid might resist that edge: it met\nThe sword of Satan, with steep force to smite\nDescending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid,\nBut with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared\nAll his right side: Then Satan first knew pain,\nAnd writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore\nThe griding sword with discontinuous wound\nPassed through him: But the ethereal substance closed,\nNot long divisible; and from the gash\nA stream of necturous humour issuing flowed\nSanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,\nAnd all his armour stained, ere while so bright.\nForthwith on all sides to his aid was run\nBy Angels many and strong, who interposed\nDefence, while others bore him on their shields\nBack to his chariot, where it stood retired\nFrom off the files of war: There they him laid\nGnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame,\nTo find himself not matchless, and his pride\nHumbled by such rebuke, so far beneath\nHis confidence to equal God in power.\nYet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout\nVital in every part, not as frail man\nIn entrails, heart of head, liver or reins,\nCannot but by annihilating die;\nNor in their liquid texture mortal wound\nReceive, no more than can the fluid air:\nAll heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,\nAll intellect, all sense; and, as they please,\nThey limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size\nAssume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare.\nMean while in other parts like deeds deserved\nMemorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,\nAnd with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array\nOf Moloch, furious king; who him defied,\nAnd at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound\nThreatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven\nRefrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon\nDown cloven to the waist, with shattered arms\nAnd uncouth pain fled bellowing. On each wing\nUriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe,\nThough huge, and in a rock of diamond armed,\nVanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai,\nTwo potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods\nDisdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,\nMangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.\nNor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy\nThe atheist crew, but with redoubled blow\nAriel, and Arioch, and the violence\nOf Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.\nI might relate of thousands, and their names\nEternize here on earth; but those elect\nAngels, contented with their fame in Heaven,\nSeek not the praise of men: The other sort,\nIn might though wonderous and in acts of war,\nNor of renown less eager, yet by doom\nCancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,\nNameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.\nFor strength from truth divided, and from just,\nIllaudable, nought merits but dispraise\nAnd ignominy; yet to glory aspires\nVain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:\nTherefore eternal silence be their doom.\nAnd now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,\nWith many an inroad gored; deformed rout\nEntered, and foul disorder; all the ground\nWith shivered armour strown, and on a heap\nChariot and charioteer lay overturned,\nAnd fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled\nO'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host\nDefensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,\nThen first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,\nFled ignominious, to such evil brought\nBy sin of disobedience; till that hour\nNot liable to fear, or flight, or pain.\nFar otherwise the inviolable Saints,\nIn cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,\nInvulnerable, impenetrably armed;\nSuch high advantages their innocence\nGave them above their foes; not to have sinned,\nNot to have disobeyed; in fight they stood\nUnwearied, unobnoxious to be pained\nBy wound, though from their place by violence moved,\nNow Night her course began, and, over Heaven\nInducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,\nAnd silence on the odious din of war:\nUnder her cloudy covert both retired,\nVictor and vanquished: On the foughten field\nMichael and his Angels prevalent\nEncamping, placed in guard their watches round,\nCherubick waving fires: On the other part,\nSatan with his rebellious disappeared,\nFar in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest,\nHis potentates to council called by night;\nAnd in the midst thus undismayed began.\nO now in danger tried, now known in arms\nNot to be overpowered, Companions dear,\nFound worthy not of liberty alone,\nToo mean pretence! but what we more affect,\nHonour, dominion, glory, and renown;\nWho have sustained one day in doubtful fight,\n(And if one day, why not eternal days?)\nWhat Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send\nAgainst us from about his throne, and judged\nSufficient to subdue us to his will,\nBut proves not so: Then fallible, it seems,\nOf future we may deem him, though till now\nOmniscient thought. True is, less firmly armed,\nSome disadvantage we endured and pain,\nTill now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;\nSince now we find this our empyreal form\nIncapable of mortal injury,\nImperishable, and, though pierced with wound,\nSoon closing, and by native vigour healed.\nOf evil then so small as easy think\nThe remedy; perhaps more valid arms,\nWeapons more violent, when next we meet,\nMay serve to better us, and worse our foes,\nOr equal what between us made the odds,\nIn nature none: If other hidden cause\nLeft them superiour, while we can preserve\nUnhurt our minds, and understanding sound,\nDue search and consultation will disclose.\nHe sat; and in the assembly next upstood\nNisroch, of Principalities the prime;\nAs one he stood escaped from cruel fight,\nSore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn,\nAnd cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.\nDeliverer from new Lords, leader to free\nEnjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard\nFor Gods, and too unequal work we find,\nAgainst unequal arms to fight in pain,\nAgainst unpained, impassive; from which evil\nRuin must needs ensue; for what avails\nValour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain\nWhich all subdues, and makes remiss the hands\nOf mightiest? Sense of pleasure we may well\nSpare out of life perhaps, and not repine,\nBut live content, which is the calmest life:\nBut pain is perfect misery, the worst\nOf evils, and, excessive, overturns\nAll patience. He, who therefore can invent\nWith what more forcible we may offend\nOur yet unwounded enemies, or arm\nOurselves with like defence, to me deserves\nNo less than for deliverance what we owe.\nWhereto with look composed Satan replied.\nNot uninvented that, which thou aright\nBelievest so main to our success, I bring.\nWhich of us who beholds the bright surface\nOf this ethereous mould whereon we stand,\nThis continent of spacious Heaven, adorned\nWith plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold;\nWhose eye so superficially surveys\nThese things, as not to mind from whence they grow\nDeep under ground, materials dark and crude,\nOf spiritous and fiery spume, till touched\nWith Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth\nSo beauteous, opening to the ambient light?\nThese in their dark nativity the deep\nShall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame;\nWhich, into hollow engines, long and round,\nThick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire\nDilated and infuriate, shall send forth\nFrom far, with thundering noise, among our foes\nSuch implements of mischief, as shall dash\nTo pieces, and o'erwhelm whatever stands\nAdverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed\nThe Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.\nNor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn,\nEffect shall end our wish. Mean while revive;\nAbandon fear; to strength and counsel joined\nThink nothing hard, much less to be despaired.\nHe ended, and his words their drooping cheer\nEnlightened, and their languished hope revived.\nThe invention all admired, and each, how he\nTo be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed\nOnce found, which yet unfound most would have thought\nImpossible: Yet, haply, of thy race\nIn future days, if malice should abound,\nSome one intent on mischief, or inspired\nWith devilish machination, might devise\nLike instrument to plague the sons of men\nFor sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.\nForthwith from council to the work they flew;\nNone arguing stood; innumerable hands\nWere ready; in a moment up they turned\nWide the celestial soil, and saw beneath\nThe originals of nature in their crude\nConception; sulphurous and nitrous foam\nThey found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,\nConcocted and adusted they reduced\nTo blackest grain, and into store conveyed:\nPart hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth\nEntrails unlike) of mineral and stone,\nWhereof to found their engines and their balls\nOf missive ruin; part incentive reed\nProvide, pernicious with one touch to fire.\nSo all ere day-spring, under conscious night,\nSecret they finished, and in order set,\nWith silent circumspection, unespied.\nNow when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared,\nUp rose the victor-Angels, and to arms\nThe matin trumpet sung: In arms they stood\nOf golden panoply, refulgent host,\nSoon banded; others from the dawning hills\nLook round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,\nEach quarter to descry the distant foe,\nWhere lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,\nIn motion or in halt: Him soon they met\nUnder spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow\nBut firm battalion; back with speediest sail\nZophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,\nCame flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.\nArm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand,\nWhom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit\nThis day; fear not his flight;so thick a cloud\nHe comes, and settled in his face I see\nSad resolution, and secure: Let each\nHis adamantine coat gird well, and each\nFit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,\nBorne even or high; for this day will pour down,\nIf I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,\nBut rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.\nSo warned he them, aware themselves, and soon\nIn order, quit of all impediment;\nInstant without disturb they took alarm,\nAnd onward moved embattled: When behold!\nNot distant far with heavy pace the foe\nApproaching gross and huge, in hollow cube\nTraining his devilish enginery, impaled\nOn every side with shadowing squadrons deep,\nTo hide the fraud. At interview both stood\nA while; but suddenly at head appeared\nSatan, and thus was heard commanding loud.\nVanguard, to right and left the front unfold;\nThat all may see who hate us, how we seek\nPeace and composure, and with open breast\nStand ready to receive them, if they like\nOur overture; and turn not back perverse:\nBut that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!\nHeaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge\nFreely our part: ye, who appointed stand\nDo as you have in charge, and briefly touch\nWhat we propound, and loud that all may hear!\nSo scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce\nHad ended; when to right and left the front\nDivided, and to either flank retired:\nWhich to our eyes discovered, new and strange,\nA triple mounted row of pillars laid\nOn wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,\nOr hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,\nWith branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,)\nBrass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths\nWith hideous orifice gaped on us wide,\nPortending hollow truce: At each behind\nA Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed\nStood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,\nCollected stood within our thoughts amused,\nNot long; for sudden all at once their reeds\nPut forth, and to a narrow vent applied\nWith nicest touch. Immediate in a flame,\nBut soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,\nFrom those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar\nEmbowelled with outrageous noise the air,\nAnd all her entrails tore, disgorging foul\nTheir devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail\nOf iron globes; which, on the victor host\nLevelled, with such impetuous fury smote,\nThat, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,\nThough standing else as rocks, but down they fell\nBy thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;\nThe sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might\nHave easily, as Spirits, evaded swift\nBy quick contraction or remove; but now\nFoul dissipation followed, and forced rout;\nNor served it to relax their serried files.\nWhat should they do? if on they rushed, repulse\nRepeated, and indecent overthrow\nDoubled, would render them yet more despised,\nAnd to their foes a laughter; for in view\nStood ranked of Seraphim another row,\nIn posture to displode their second tire\nOf thunder: Back defeated to return\nThey worse abhorred. Satan beheld their plight,\nAnd to his mates thus in derision called.\nO Friends! why come not on these victors proud\nEre while they fierce were coming; and when we,\nTo entertain them fair with open front\nAnd breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms\nOf composition, straight they changed their minds,\nFlew off, and into strange vagaries fell,\nAs they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed\nSomewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps\nFor joy of offered peace: But I suppose,\nIf our proposals once again were heard,\nWe should compel them to a quick result.\nTo whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.\nLeader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,\nOf hard contents, and full of force urged home;\nSuch as we might perceive amused them all,\nAnd stumbled many: Who receives them right,\nHad need from head to foot well understand;\nNot understood, this gift they have besides,\nThey show us when our foes walk not upright.\nSo they among themselves in pleasant vein\nStood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond\nAll doubt of victory: Eternal Might\nTo match with their inventions they presumed\nSo easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,\nAnd all his host derided, while they stood\nA while in trouble: But they stood not long;\nRage prompted them at length, and found them arms\nAgainst such hellish mischief fit to oppose.\nForthwith (behold the excellence, the power,\nWhich God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)\nTheir arms away they threw, and to the hills\n(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven\nOf pleasure situate in hill and dale,)\nLight as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew;\nFrom their foundations loosening to and fro,\nThey plucked the seated hills, with all their load,\nRocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops\nUp-lifting bore them in their hands: Amaze,\nBe sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host,\nWhen coming towards them so dread they saw\nThe bottom of the mountains upward turned;\nTill on those cursed engines' triple-row\nThey saw them whelmed, and all their confidence\nUnder the weight of mountains buried deep;\nThemselves invaded next, and on their heads\nMain promontories flung, which in the air\nCame shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;\nTheir armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised\nInto their substance pent, which wrought them pain\nImplacable, and many a dolorous groan;\nLong struggling underneath, ere they could wind\nOut of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,\nPurest at first, now gross by sinning grown.\nThe rest, in imitation, to like arms\nBetook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:\nSo hills amid the air encountered hills,\nHurled to and fro with jaculation dire;\nThat under ground they fought in dismal shade;\nInfernal noise! war seemed a civil game\nTo this uproar; horrid confusion heaped\nUpon confusion rose: And now all Heaven\nHad gone to wrack, with ruin overspread;\nHad not the Almighty Father, where he sits\nShrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,\nConsulting on the sum of things, foreseen\nThis tumult, and permitted all, advised:\nThat his great purpose he might so fulfil,\nTo honour his anointed Son avenged\nUpon his enemies, and to declare\nAll power on him transferred: Whence to his Son,\nThe Assessour of his throne, he thus began.\nEffulgence of my glory, Son beloved,\nSon, in whose face invisible is beheld\nVisibly, what by Deity I am;\nAnd in whose hand what by decree I do,\nSecond Omnipotence! two days are past,\nTwo days, as we compute the days of Heaven,\nSince Michael and his Powers went forth to tame\nThese disobedient: Sore hath been their fight,\nAs likeliest was, when two such foes met armed;\nFor to themselves I left them; and thou knowest,\nEqual in their creation they were formed,\nSave what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought\nInsensibly, for I suspend their doom;\nWhence in perpetual fight they needs must last\nEndless, and no solution will be found:\nWar wearied hath performed what war can do,\nAnd to disordered rage let loose the reins\nWith mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes\nWild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.\nTwo days are therefore past, the third is thine;\nFor thee I have ordained it; and thus far\nHave suffered, that the glory may be thine\nOf ending this great war, since none but Thou\nCan end it. Into thee such virtue and grace\nImmense I have transfused, that all may know\nIn Heaven and Hell thy power above compare;\nAnd, this perverse commotion governed thus,\nTo manifest thee worthiest to be Heir\nOf all things; to be Heir, and to be King\nBy sacred unction, thy deserved right.\nGo then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might;\nAscend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels\nThat shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war,\nMy bow and thunder, my almighty arms\nGird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;\nPursue these sons of darkness, drive them out\nFrom all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep:\nThere let them learn, as likes them, to despise\nGod, and Messiah his anointed King.\nHe said, and on his Son with rays direct\nShone full; he all his Father full expressed\nIneffably into his face received;\nAnd thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.\nO Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,\nFirst, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st\nTo glorify thy Son, I always thee,\nAs is most just: This I my glory account,\nMy exaltation, and my whole delight,\nThat thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will\nFulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.\nScepter and power, thy giving, I assume,\nAnd gladlier shall resign, when in the end\nThou shalt be all in all, and I in thee\nFor ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:\nBut whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on\nThy terrours, as I put thy mildness on,\nImage of thee in all things; and shall soon,\nArmed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled;\nTo their prepared ill mansion driven down,\nTo chains of darkness, and the undying worm;\nThat from thy just obedience could revolt,\nWhom to obey is happiness entire.\nThen shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure\nFar separate, circling thy holy mount,\nUnfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,\nHymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.\nSo said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose\nFrom the right hand of Glory where he sat;\nAnd the third sacred morn began to shine,\nDawning through Heaven. Forth rushed with whirlwind sound\nThe chariot of Paternal Deity,\nFlashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,\nItself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed\nBy four Cherubick shapes; four faces each\nHad wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all\nAnd wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels\nOf beryl, and careering fires between;\nOver their heads a crystal firmament,\nWhereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure\nAmber, and colours of the showery arch.\nHe, in celestial panoply all armed\nOf radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,\nAscended; at his right hand Victory\nSat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow\nAnd quiver with three-bolted thunder stored;\nAnd from about him fierce effusion rolled\nOf smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:\nAttended with ten thousand thousand Saints,\nHe onward came; far off his coming shone;\nAnd twenty thousand (I their number heard)\nChariots of God, half on each hand, were seen;\nHe on the wings of Cherub rode sublime\nOn the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,\nIllustrious far and wide; but by his own\nFirst seen: Them unexpected joy surprised,\nWhen the great ensign of Messiah blazed\nAloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven;\nUnder whose conduct Michael soon reduced\nHis army, circumfused on either wing,\nUnder their Head imbodied all in one.\nBefore him Power Divine his way prepared;\nAt his command the uprooted hills retired\nEach to his place; they heard his voice, and went\nObsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,\nAnd with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.\nThis saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,\nAnd to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,\nInsensate, hope conceiving from despair.\nIn heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?\nBut to convince the proud what signs avail,\nOr wonders move the obdurate to relent?\nThey, hardened more by what might most reclaim,\nGrieving to see his glory, at the sight\nTook envy; and, aspiring to his highth,\nStood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud\nWeening to prosper, and at length prevail\nAgainst God and Messiah, or to fall\nIn universal ruin last; and now\nTo final battle drew, disdaining flight,\nOr faint retreat; when the great Son of God\nTo all his host on either hand thus spake.\nStand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,\nYe Angels armed; this day from battle rest:\nFaithful hath been your warfare, and of God\nAccepted, fearless in his righteous cause;\nAnd as ye have received, so have ye done,\nInvincibly: But of this cursed crew\nThe punishment to other hand belongs;\nVengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:\nNumber to this day's work is not ordained,\nNor multitude; stand only, and behold\nGod's indignation on these godless poured\nBy me; not you, but me, they have despised,\nYet envied; against me is all their rage,\nBecause the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme\nKingdom, and power, and glory appertains,\nHath honoured me, according to his will.\nTherefore to me their doom he hath assigned;\nThat they may have their wish, to try with me\nIn battle which the stronger proves; they all,\nOr I alone against them; since by strength\nThey measure all, of other excellence\nNot emulous, nor care who them excels;\nNor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.\nSo spake the Son, and into terrour changed\nHis countenance too severe to be beheld,\nAnd full of wrath bent on his enemies.\nAt once the Four spread out their starry wings\nWith dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs\nOf his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound\nOf torrent floods, or of a numerous host.\nHe on his impious foes right onward drove,\nGloomy as night; under his burning wheels\nThe stedfast empyrean shook throughout,\nAll but the throne itself of God. Full soon\nAmong them he arrived; in his right hand\nGrasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent\nBefore him, such as in their souls infixed\nPlagues: They, astonished, all resistance lost,\nAll courage; down their idle weapons dropt:\nO'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode\nOf Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,\nThat wished the mountains now might be again\nThrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.\nNor less on either side tempestuous fell\nHis arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four\nDistinct with eyes, and from the living wheels\nDistinct alike with multitude of eyes;\nOne Spirit in them ruled; and every eye\nGlared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire\nAmong the accursed, that withered all their strength,\nAnd of their wonted vigour left them drained,\nExhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.\nYet half his strength he put not forth, but checked\nHis thunder in mid volley; for he meant\nNot to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:\nThe overthrown he raised, and as a herd\nOf goats or timorous flock together thronged\nDrove them before him thunder-struck, pursued\nWith terrours, and with furies, to the bounds\nAnd crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,\nRolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed\nInto the wasteful deep: The monstrous sight\nStruck them with horrour backward, but far worse\nUrged them behind: Headlong themselves they threw\nDown from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath\nBurnt after them to the bottomless pit.\nHell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw\nHeaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled\nAffrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep\nHer dark foundations, and too fast had bound.\nNine days they fell: Confounded Chaos roared,\nAnd felt tenfold confusion in their fall\nThrough his wild anarchy, so huge a rout\nIncumbered him with ruin: Hell at last\nYawning received them whole, and on them closed;\nHell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire\nUnquenchable, the house of woe and pain.\nDisburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired\nHer mural breach, returning whence it rolled.\nSole victor, from the expulsion of his foes,\nMessiah his triumphal chariot turned:\nTo meet him all his Saints, who silent stood\nEye-witnesses of his almighty acts,\nWith jubilee advanced; and, as they went,\nShaded with branching palm, each Order bright,\nSung triumph, and him sung victorious King,\nSon, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,\nWorthiest to reign: He, celebrated, rode\nTriumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts\nAnd temple of his Mighty Father throned\nOn high; who into glory him received,\nWhere now he sits at the right hand of bliss.\nThus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,\nAt thy request, and that thou mayest beware\nBy what is past, to thee I have revealed\nWhat might have else to human race been hid;\nThe discord which befel, and war in Heaven\nAmong the angelick Powers, and the deep fall\nOf those too high aspiring, who rebelled\nWith Satan; he who envies now thy state,\nWho now is plotting how he may seduce\nThee also from obedience, that, with him\nBereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake\nHis punishment, eternal misery;\nWhich would be all his solace and revenge,\nAs a despite done against the Most High,\nThee once to gain companion of his woe.\nBut listen not to his temptations, warn\nThy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,\nBy terrible example, the reward\nOf disobedience; firm they might have stood,\nYet fell; remember, and fear to transgress."}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " We investigate the structure of multiple correlation sequences that are defined by measure-preserving actions of commuting transformations. When the iterates of these transformations are integer polynomials, we demonstrate that any correlation sequence of this kind can be expressed as the sum of a nilsequence and a small error term in terms of uniform density; this result was previously established only for measure-preserving actions involving a single transformation. We then apply this decomposition result to establish convergence criteria for multiple ergodic averages that involve iterates growing linearly, and we reveal the rather unexpected finding that for such sequences, convergence results for actions of commuting transformations can be derived automatically from the specific case of actions of a single transformation. Our approach to proving the decomposition result is distinct from earlier works by V. Bergelson, B. Host, B. Kra, and A. Leibman, as it does not depend on the theory of characteristic factors. Instead, it employs a straightforward orthogonality argument, with the primary tool being an inverse theorem by B. Host and B.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Since the advent of generative neural networks, there has been a significant advancement in addressing the image generation challenge. Numerous studies have explored their applications, including image restoration, style transfer, and image completion. However, there has been limited research focused on generating objects in uncontrolled real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for generating vehicle images in real-world scenes. By utilizing a subnet based on prior work in image completion, our model shapes the form of an object. The details of the objects are refined through an additional colorization and enhancement subnet, leading to improved quality of the generated objects. Unlike many other approaches, our method does not require any segmentation layout but still produces a plausible vehicle in the image. We assess our method using images from the Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) and Cityscape datasets, which are commonly employed for object detection and image segmentation tasks. The effectiveness of the images generated by the proposed method has also been evaluated using a widely used object detection algorithm and the FID score."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " The precise and rapid extraction of lung volumes from computed tomography (CT) scans continues to be highly sought after in clinical settings, as existing methods do not offer a universal solution due to significant anatomical variations in the lungs and the presence of pathologies. Manual annotation, which is currently the gold standard, is labor-intensive and often influenced by human bias. Conversely, the latest fully automated lung segmentation techniques have not been successfully integrated into clinical practice because they struggle to effectively incorporate human input for addressing misclassifications and inaccuracies. This paper introduces an interactive, efficient, and robust lung annotation tool for CT images. The proposed annotation tool generates an \"as accurate as possible\" initial annotation based on fuzzy-connectedness image segmentation, followed by efficient manual refinement of the initial extraction if deemed necessary by the practitioner. To ensure maximum flexibility for users, our annotation tool is compatible with three major operating systems (Windows, Linux, and macOS). The quantitative results comparing our free software with commercially available lung segmentation tools demonstrate a higher level of consistency and precision in our software, with significant potential to improve the performance of routine clinical tasks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n\u0391\u0441\u0441ur\u0430t\u0435 \u0430nd f\u0430st \u0435\u0445tr\u0430\u0441t\u0456\u043en \u043ef lung v\u043elum\u0435s fr\u043em \u0441\u043em\u0440ut\u0435d t\u043em\u043egr\u0430\u0440h\u0443 (\u0421\u03a4)\ns\u0441\u0430ns r\u0435m\u0430\u0456ns \u0456n \u0430 gr\u0435\u0430t d\u0435m\u0430nd \u0456n th\u0435 \u0441l\u0456n\u0456\u0441\u0430l \u0435nv\u0456r\u043enm\u0435nt b\u0435\u0441\u0430us\u0435 th\u0435\n\u0430v\u0430\u0456l\u0430bl\u0435 m\u0435th\u043eds f\u0430\u0456l t\u043e \u0440r\u043ev\u0456d\u0435 \u0430 g\u0435n\u0435r\u0456\u0441 s\u043elut\u0456\u043en du\u0435 t\u043e w\u0456d\u0435 \u0430n\u0430t\u043em\u0456\u0441\u0430l\nv\u0430r\u0456\u0430t\u0456\u043ens \u043ef lungs \u0430nd \u0435\u0445\u0456st\u0435n\u0441\u0435 \u043ef \u0440\u0430th\u043el\u043eg\u0456\u0435s. \u041c\u0430nu\u0430l \u0430nn\u043et\u0430t\u0456\u043en, \u0441urr\u0435nt\ng\u043eld st\u0430nd\u0430rd, \u0456s t\u0456m\u0435 \u0441\u043ensum\u0456ng \u0430nd \u043eft\u0435n subj\u0435\u0441t t\u043e hum\u0430n b\u0456\u0430s. \u041en th\u0435 \u043eth\u0435r\nh\u0430nd, \u0441urr\u0435nt st\u0430t\u0435-\u043ef-th\u0435-\u0430rt full\u0443 \u0430ut\u043em\u0430t\u0435d lung s\u0435gm\u0435nt\u0430t\u0456\u043en m\u0435th\u043eds f\u0430\u0456l\nt\u043e m\u0430k\u0435 th\u0435\u0456r w\u0430\u0443 \u0456nt\u043e th\u0435 \u0441l\u0456n\u0456\u0441\u0430l \u0440r\u0430\u0441t\u0456\u0441\u0435 du\u0435 t\u043e th\u0435\u0456r \u0456n\u0430b\u0456l\u0456t\u0443 t\u043e\n\u0435ff\u0456\u0441\u0456\u0435ntl\u0443 \u0456n\u0441\u043er\u0440\u043er\u0430t\u0435 hum\u0430n \u0456n\u0440ut f\u043er h\u0430ndl\u0456ng m\u0456s\u0441l\u0430ss\u0456f\u0456\u0441\u0430t\u0456\u043ens \u0430nd \u0440r\u0430\u0445\u0456s.\n\u03a4h\u0456s \u0440\u0430\u0440\u0435r \u0440r\u0435s\u0435nts \u0430 lung \u0430nn\u043et\u0430t\u0456\u043en t\u043e\u043el f\u043er \u0421\u0422 \u0456m\u0430g\u0435s th\u0430t \u0456s \u0456nt\u0435r\u0430\u0441t\u0456v\u0435,\n\u0435ff\u0456\u0441\u0456\u0435nt, \u0430nd r\u043ebust. \u0422h\u0435 \u0440r\u043e\u0440\u043es\u0435d \u0430nn\u043et\u0430t\u0456\u043en t\u043e\u043el \u0440r\u043edu\u0441\u0435s \u0430n \"\u0430s \u0430\u0441\u0441ur\u0430t\u0435 \u0430s\n\u0440\u043ess\u0456bl\u0435\" \u0456n\u0456t\u0456\u0430l \u0430nn\u043et\u0430t\u0456\u043en b\u0430s\u0435d \u043en th\u0435 fuzz\u0443-\u0441\u043enn\u0435\u0441t\u0435dn\u0435ss \u0456m\u0430g\u0435\ns\u0435gm\u0435nt\u0430t\u0456\u043en, f\u043ell\u043ew\u0435d b\u0443 \u0435ff\u0456\u0441\u0456\u0435nt m\u0430nu\u0430l f\u0456\u0445\u0430t\u0456\u043en \u043ef th\u0435 \u0456n\u0456t\u0456\u0430l \u0435\u0445tr\u0430\u0441t\u0456\u043en\n\u0456f d\u0435\u0435m\u0435d n\u0435\u0441\u0435ss\u0430r\u0443 b\u0443 th\u0435 \u0440r\u0430\u0441t\u0456t\u0456\u043en\u0435r. \u03a4\u043e \u0440r\u043ev\u0456d\u0435 m\u0430\u0445\u0456mum fl\u0435\u0445\u0456b\u0456l\u0456t\u0443 t\u043e th\u0435\nus\u0435rs, \u043eur \u0430nn\u043et\u0430t\u0456\u043en t\u043e\u043el \u0456s su\u0440\u0440\u043ert\u0435d \u0456n thr\u0435\u0435 m\u0430j\u043er \u043e\u0440\u0435r\u0430t\u0456ng s\u0443st\u0435ms\n(W\u0456nd\u043ews, L\u0456nu\u0445, \u0430nd th\u0435 \u041c\u0430\u0441 \u039fS \u0425). \u0422h\u0435 qu\u0430nt\u0456t\u0430t\u0456v\u0435 r\u0435sults \u0441\u043em\u0440\u0430r\u0456ng \u043eur fr\u0435\u0435\ns\u043eftw\u0430r\u0435 w\u0456th \u0441\u043emm\u0435r\u0441\u0456\u0430ll\u0443 \u0430v\u0430\u0456l\u0430bl\u0435 lung s\u0435gm\u0435nt\u0430t\u0456\u043en t\u043e\u043els sh\u043ew h\u0456gh\u0435r d\u0435gr\u0435\u0435\n\u043ef \u0441\u043ens\u0456st\u0435n\u0441\u0443 \u0430nd \u0440r\u0435\u0441\u0456s\u0456\u043en \u043ef \u043eur s\u043eftw\u0430r\u0435 w\u0456th \u0430 \u0441\u043ens\u0456d\u0435r\u0430bl\u0435 \u0440\u043et\u0435nt\u0456\u0430l t\u043e\n\u0435nh\u0430n\u0441\u0435 th\u0435 \u0440\u0435rf\u043erm\u0430n\u0441\u0435 \u043ef r\u043eut\u0456n\u0435 \u0441l\u0456n\u0456\u0441\u0430l t\u0430sks."}]

This marks the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to give their Christmas tree a personal touch, with notable past decorators including Tracey Emin, who worked on the tree in 2002.\n\nThe tree is on display in the gallery's foyer, where its light bulb decorations are dimly lit, using ordinary household bulbs connected by string. Meanwhile, the plates adorning the branches will be auctioned off to raise funds for the children's charity ArtWorks. Richard Wentworth's artistic career spans many decades, having worked as an assistant to renowned sculptor Henry Moore in the late 1960s. His reputation as a sculptor grew significantly in the 1980s, and he has since become a highly influential teacher, shaping the work of many artists over the past two decades.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nThe ability of neural networks to learn and refine their skills over time, while retaining previously acquired knowledge, is crucial for specific applications. However, current neural networks often struggle with a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), where they forget recently learned functions when presented with new tasks. This issue is particularly significant in clinical settings, where sensitive patient data cannot be stored or accessed. To address this challenge, the objective of Continual Learning (CL) is to develop a system that can adapt to new tasks without compromising previously acquired knowledge. In this study, we propose a novel Continual Learning approach for brain segmentation, where a single network is trained on samples from multiple domains in succession. Building on an importance-driven technique, we adapt it for medical image segmentation and incorporate learning rate regularization to minimize the loss of the network's knowledge. Our results demonstrate that directly controlling the adaptation of fundamental network parameters can effectively reduce Catastrophic Forgetting in segmentation tasks across domains."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nThe capability of neural systems to continuously learn and adapt to new tasks\nwhile preserving previous experience is important for certain systems.

The company earned $0.54 per share in the fourth quarter, beating the First Call/Thompson Financial consensus estimate by $0.04. In the same quarter last year, Analog Devices earned $0.20 per share.\n\nThe company's sales for the quarter increased by 87% to $806 million, compared to $431 million in the year-ago period. Net income also rose to $206.5 million, up from $73.2 million last year. The company's gross margin improved to 58.6% from 52.2% during the quarter.\n\nFor the fiscal year, Analog Devices earned $588.8 million on sales of $2.58 billion. In the previous fiscal year, the company's sales were $1.45 billion, and its net income was $204.8 million. On a per-share basis, Analog Devices earned $1.54 in fiscal 2000, compared to $0.57 in fiscal 1999.\n\nThe company also announced plans to repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock, which will be used for its stock option plans and other employee stock-based benefit plans.\n\nLooking ahead to the first quarter of its new fiscal year, Analog Devices expects 7-10% sequential revenue growth. The company sees first-quarter earnings per share coming in between $0.58 and $0.60 per share, which is higher than the current consensus estimate of $0.54.\n\nAnalog Devices' President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman expressed optimism about the company's future prospects, stating that the company believes its revenue growth will be constrained by supply, not demand. He also mentioned that the company's first look for the entire year of fiscal 2001 is very encouraging, with revenues potentially exceeding fiscal 2000's by more than 50%.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nNEWS HIGHLIGHTS\nWarren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway has acquired a 1% stake in Tricon Global Restaurants, the parent company of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC.

The company earned $0.54 a share in the fourth quarter,\nahead of the First Call/Thompson Financial consensus estimate by\n$0.04. In last year's fourth quarter, Analog Devices earned\n$0.20.\nSales for the quarter were up 87% to $806 million from $431\nmillion in the year-ago period. Net income increased to $206.5\nmillion, compared to $73.2 million last year. The company's\ngross margin improved during the quarter to 58.6% from 52.2%.\nFor the fiscal year, Analog Devices earned $588.8 million on\nsales of $2.58 billion. In the previous fiscal year, the\ncompany's sales were $1.45 billion, and its net income was\n$204.8 million. On a per-share basis, Analog Devices earned\n$1.54 a share in fiscal 2000, versus $0.57 in fiscal 1999.\nThe company also announced yesterday that it will be\nrepurchasing up to 15 million shares of its common stock.\nCurrently, there are about 356 million shares of Analog Devices\ncommon stock outstanding. The shares are being bought back for\nuse in the company's stock option plans, as well as other\nemployee stock-based benefit plans.\nLooking ahead to the first quarter of its new fiscal year,\nAnalog Devices expects 7-10% sequential revenue growth. The\ncompany sees first-quarter earnings per share to come in between\n$0.58 and $0.60 a share. The current consensus estimate for\nAnalog Devices' first quarter is $0.54. The company says it\nbelieves its revenue growth will be constrained by supply, not\ndemand.\nAnalog Devices' President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman said, \"Our\nfirst look for the entire year of fiscal 2001 is also very\nencouraging. We currently believe that fiscal 2001's revenues\ncould exceed fiscal 2000's by more than 50%, which would result\nin fiscal 2001 revenues of more than $3.8 billion.\"\n_________________________________________________________________\nNEWS TO GO\nIn an SEC filing yesterday, it was disclosed that the man who\nhas for so long believed in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) also apparently\nbelieves at least a little in Pepsi (NYSE: PEP). Warren\nBuffett's company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) has acquired\nabout a 1% stake in Tricon Global Restaurants (NYSE: YUM), the\nPepsi spin-off that includes fast-food restaurants Pizza Hut,\nTaco Bell, and KFC. Close to 98% of those restaurants serve\nPepsi products. Buffett owns 8.1% of Coca-Cola and is also a\ndirector for the company.\nFord Motor Company (NYSE: F) said yesterday that it will allow\ncustomers ordering new 2001 Explorers to elect to have Goodyear\ntires on their vehicles over the standard Firestones. This move\nformally allows customers to have the new Explorers delivered\nwith Goodyear tires, as opposed to switching off the Firestones\nfor the Goodyears before the purchase. It's estimated that\nbetween 5-10% of Explorer customers have been asking dealers to\nchange the tires on their new trucks before driving them off of\nthe lot, thanks to the Firestone recall of 6.5 million tires. In\nstates where the tire problems were the worst, up to 40% of\ncustomers have been asking for the switch.\nE-commerce software company BEA Systems (Nasdaq: BEAS) reported\nthird-quarter earnings yesterday after the bell. The company's\npro forma net income was $31.3 million, or $0.07 a share. Last\nyear, the company's pro forma net income was $10.4 million, or\n$0.03 a share. BEA beat the consensus estimate according to\nFirst Call/Thompson Financial by a penny. Revenues grew 77% to\n$244 million, from last year's $126.5 million.\nOptical networking company Sycamore Networks (Nasdaq: SCMR)\nannounced fiscal first-quarter results after the market's close\nyesterday. Sycamore's pro forma net income was $6 million, or\n$0.02 a diluted share, for the quarter. Last year, it lost $4.1\nmillion, or $0.02 a share, in the first quarter. The company\nearned a penny more than analysts had expected. Revenues grew by\n517% to $120.4 million, compared to the year-ago period's $19.5\nmillion.\n_________________________________________________________________\nEDITORS' PICK\nOur writers love to share their opinions, so we asked them to\nprovide a list of blue-chip stocks they find interesting.\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195696\n_______________________________________________________________\n-News & Commentary\n http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195697\n-Fool Community\n http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195698\n-Post of the Day\n http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195699\n-Latest Fribble\n http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195700\n-Latest Market Numbers\n http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195701\n____________________________________________________________\nMy Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195702\nMy Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195703\nMy Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195704\nFool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195705\nMy E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195706\n Sponsored By: iShares\n iShares(SM).

[{"role": "user", "content": " Approximately 70 years ago, a 10-year-old Polish-Jewish boy named Leopold (Leo) Gursky falls for his neighbor, Alma Mereminski. Their relationship blossoms over a decade, during which Leo pens three books for Alma, the only person he truly loves. \n\nThe first book is overly realistic and dull, the second is pure fiction and lacks believability, while the final book, \"The History of Love,\" is a tribute to his affection for her. Leo vows to never love anyone else but Alma. \n\nAt 20, Alma is sent to the United States by her father, who is alarmed by the rising threats from fascist Germany. Unbeknownst to Leo, Alma is pregnant and dreams of reuniting with him in America. \n\nSoon after, the Germans invade Poland, forcing Leo to hide in the woods, surviving on roots, small creatures, insects, and whatever he can pilfer from farmers' cellars. \n\nAfter two years of concealment, he makes his way to America, only to be heartbroken to learn that Alma believed he had perished in the war and has married the factory manager's son. \n\nHis devastation deepens upon discovering that she has had another child with her husband. \n\nHe pleads with her to join him, but she declines. \n\nHowever, she reveals that they have a son named Isaac, who is now five years old. With a heavy heart, Leo departs and becomes a locksmith. \n\nFrom a distance, Leo watches Isaac grow, yearning to be part of his life but too afraid to approach him. \n\nIn the present, Leo is a solitary old man awaiting death, accompanied by his childhood friend Bruno, who may only exist in his imagination, especially since Alma has been gone for five years. \n\nLeo keeps tabs on Isaac, who has become a renowned writer, bringing Leo joy as he believes Isaac inherited his talent. Leo's sorrow intensifies when he reads in a newspaper that Isaac has died at 60, leading him to obsess over finding his place in his son's life, even breaking into Isaac\u2019s home to see if he had read \"Words for Everything.\" \n\nLeo longs to reread \"The History of Love,\" so he seeks a copy of the book he had given to his friend Zvi Litvinoff, who moved to Chile. \n\nTheir friendship began when Leo fell gravely ill in Poland and wrote his own obituary, which Lev stole in hopes of keeping his friend alive. \n\nLeo writes to Zvi, but his wife informs him that the book was lost in a flood, concealing the fact that her husband did not author \"The History of Love.\" Unbeknownst to Leo, the book had been published in a limited run of two thousand copies in Spanish, credited to Zvi Litvinoff, who believed Leo had died in Poland. Zvi, feeling guilty for plagiarizing, added Leo\u2019s stolen obituary as the final chapter, claiming it was a condition for publication, even though it did not fit the narrative. When Leo inquires about the book, Zvi's wife, Rosa, fearing her husband would lose his reputation if the truth emerged, lies about the manuscript being destroyed and even stages a flood in their home to support her claim. Zvi passed away without revealing the true author of \"The History of Love.\" \n\nIn a parallel narrative, a 15-year-old Jewish girl named Alma Singer, named after the character in \"The History of Love,\" struggles with the loss of her father to cancer. Her mother becomes withdrawn, immersing herself in her work as a book translator. \n\nHer younger brother, Bird, named for his attempt to fly by jumping from a second-story window, seeks solace in religion, believing he is among God's chosen, which further alienates him from reality. Alma finds comfort in one of her father's pastimes: wilderness survival. She also harbors feelings for her Russian pen pal, Misha, who has relocated to New York. They become a couple but eventually part ways due to Alma's uncertainty. One day, her mother receives a letter from a mysterious man named Jacob Marcus, who requests her to translate \"The History of Love\" from Spanish to English for $100,000, to be paid in installments of $25,000 as the work progresses. Alma\u2019s mother is suspicious of the offer, but the stranger reveals that his mother used to read the book to him as a child, making it deeply sentimental. Alma sees this as a chance to help her mother heal and transforms her mother\u2019s straightforward letters to Jacob Marcus into more romantic versions. \n\nWhen the correspondence halts before her mother finishes the translation, Alma decides to track down the enigmatic client. \n\nShe begins by documenting everything she knows about Jacob Marcus in her diary, concluding that the Alma in the book must be real and sets out to find her. Her search for Alma Mereminski proves challenging, but she eventually discovers that Alma may have married and is now known as Moritz.

The two begin a relationship that develops over the course of 10 years. In this time, Leo writes three books that he gives to Alma since she is the only person whom he deeply cares about. \n\nThe first book is too realistic and boring, the second one is entirely fiction and unconvincing, and the last book is dedicated to his love: \"The History of Love.\" Leo promises he will never love anyone but Alma. \n\nAlma, now 20, is sent to the United States by her father, who feared the alarming news concerning fascist Germany. Leo does not know that Alma is pregnant and dreams of going to America to meet her. \n\nA short time after, the Germans invade Poland and Leo takes cover in the woods, living on roots, small animals, bugs and what he can steal from farmers' cellars. \n\nAfter two years of hiding he goes to America and finds Alma but is shocked to hear she thought he had died in the war and had married the son of the manager of the factory she works at. \n\nHe is devastated when he finds she has had another child with her husband. \n\nHe asks her to come with him, but she refuses. \n\nShe tells him, however, about his son Isaac who is now five years old. Heartbroken, Leo leaves and becomes a locksmith. \n\nLeo regularly watches Isaac from a distance, wishing to be part of the boy\u2019s life but scared to come in contact with him. \n\nIn the present day, Leo is a lonely old man who waits for his death, along with his recently found (most probably in his imagination) childhood friend, Bruno, especially since Alma has been dead for five years. \n\nLeo still keeps track of his son, who has become a famous writer, much to Leo\u2019s enjoyment since he believes Isaac inherited the talent from his father. Leo's depression deepens when he reads in a newspaper that his son has died at the age of 60, and Leo develops an obsession with finding his place in his son's world, to the extent that he breaks into Isaac\u2019s house to see if he had read \"Words for Everything\". \n\nLeo wants to reread \"The History of Love\", so he tries to obtain a copy of the book that he gave to his friend Zvi Litvinoff, who had immigrated to Chile. \n\nTheir friendship dates from when Leo fell gravely ill in Poland and wrote his own obituary, after which Lev stole it in the hope that it would keep his friend alive. \n\nLeo writes a letter to Zvi, but his wife informs him that the book was destroyed in a flood, conspiring to hide that her husband did not write \"The History of Love\". Unknown to Leo is that the book had been published in a small printing of two thousand copies (and re-published upon the supposed author's death) in Spanish, but under the name of Zvi Litvinoff, who copied the book thinking Leo was killed in Poland. Zvi felt so guilty for copying his book that he added his friend\u2019s stolen obituary as the last chapter, telling the publisher that including the obituary was conditional to printing the book, although doing so did not make sense with the plot. When Leo called to recover the book, Zvi's wife, Rosa, fearing her husband would lose his fame if the world found out his well-regarded book was plagiarized, lied by saying the manuscript had been destroyed in a flood, and then manufactured a flood in her house to realize the lie. Zvi died later without telling the world about the real author of \"The History of Love\". \n\nIn a parallel story, a 15-year-old Jewish girl, Alma Singer, named after the Alma in \"The History of Love\", her parents\u2019 favorite book, is struggling to cope with the loss of her father due to cancer. Her mother becomes distant and lonely, escaping into her work of book translation. \n\nHer younger brother Bird, so called for jumping from the second story of a building hoping he could fly, seeks refuge in religion and believes himself to be one of God\u2019s chosen people, thus distancing himself from reality. Alma finds refuge in one of her father\u2019s hobbies: surviving in the wild. Alma also bears a crush on her Russian pen friend Misha, who has moved to New York. The two become a couple but they break up because of Alma\u2019s incertitude. One day, her mother receives a letter from a mysterious man named Jacob Marcus who requests that she translate \"The History of Love\" from Spanish to English for $100,000 dollars, to be paid in increments of $25,000 as the work progresses. Alma\u2019s mother finds the sum suspicious, but the stranger confesses that his mother used to read the book to him when he was a child, so it has a great sentimental value. Alma sees this as an opportunity to help her mother recover from her depression and changes her mother\u2019s straightforward letters to Jacob Marcus into more romantic versions. \n\nWhen the letters stop before her mother completes the translation of the book, Alma decides to find the mysterious client. \n\nShe starts by noting down what she knows about Jacob Marcus in her diary, and concludes that the Alma in the book was real and proceeds to find her. She struggles in her search for Alma Mereminski, but succeeds when she realizes that Alma could have married and finds her under the name of Moritz. She is disappointed to hear that Alma has been dead for five years. However, she finds out that Isaac Moritz is the first of Alma's sons and a famous writer. \n\nWhen she starts reading his bestselling book, she finds that the main character's name is Jacob Marcus and realizes that Isaac Moritz had hired her mother to translate the book. \n\nIsaac is dead, however, which explains why his letters had stopped coming to their home. To be sure about her suspicions, Alma leaves a note on Isaac\u2019s door asking who the writer of the novel is. \n\nIn the meanwhile, Bird finds Alma\u2019s diary and misinterprets the names Alma Mereminski and Alma Moritz as being his sister\u2019s real names, and believes they had different fathers. Isaac\u2019s brother calls Alma, after reading the note and the original manuscript of the book, to tell her that Gursky is the real author, but Bird answers the telephone and it confuses him even further. He now suspects that Leopold Gursky is Alma's real father. \n\nTo cleanse his sin of bragging and to regain the status as one of the chosen ones, he decides to set up a meeting with Alma and Gursky, thus doing a good deed without anybody knowing except God. When the two receive the letter regarding their meeting, both are confused: Alma tries to discover which of the people she met during her searches could have sent her the note, while Leo comes to believe it was Alma who sent him the note, despite her being dead. \n\nLeo settles himself on a park bench, waiting a long while for Alma to appear. He ponders his life, key moments from his past, the loss of his love, and what it means to be human. He imagines that he will die while he is waiting there, his own death and mortality being one of his preoccupations in the novel. When Alma finally appears, he and she are both confused, although at first Leo believes that she is his Alma from the past and that she is really just in his imagination. \n\nAfter he realizes that she doesn't look like his Alma, and he gets confirmation from a man walking by that the Alma who is there is actually real, Leo talks to her briefly about Bruno and Isaac, while Alma starts piecing together the puzzle of who Leo is. \n\nWhen Alma asks him if he ever loved a girl named Alma Mereminski, the old man finally feels a sense of transcendence in being recognized at long last, and instead of being able to respond to Alma's questions with words, he keeps tapping his fingers twice against her. She puts her head on his shoulder and hugs him, and he is finally able to speak again, saying her name three times and giving her her own feeling of transcendence at finally being recognized, too. (Some readers believe that Leo has a heart attack and dies at this point, possibly because of Leo's earlier assumption that he is about to die, and also because he says during this meeting with Alma, \"I felt my heart surge. \n\nI thought: I've lived this long. \n\nPlease. \n\nA little longer won't kill me.\" A more compelling case can be made that the novel, for all its poignancy, simply ends with this mutually transcendent moment for these two characters.) \n\nThe last chapter is entitled \"The Death of Leopold Gursky\" and is identical with the last chapter of the book inside a book \"The History of Love\", both being the self-written obituary of Leopold Gursky. \n\nBy ending the novel this way, Krauss is richly alluding to earlier parts of the novel and to her theme of how words keep people alive for us, indeed, make people in danger of becoming invisible, visible. \n\nZvi Litvinoff carried Leo's self-written obit in his pocket for years, as a talisman guarding against Leo's death. \n\nLitvinoff, when preparing \"History of Love\" for publication, insists that his editor include the Leo Gursky obit at the end, his way of ensuring that Leo will continue to \"live\" in the hearts of all readers of the book. And finally, Nicole Krauss includes the same obit at the end of her novel, as a way of urging all readers to keep this Leo, and all Leos, alive."}]

The 1 cent surcharge was approved by the CPUC in early January. At the time, the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM), to which we belong, had protested its application to DA customers. Nonetheless, the CPUC approved the surcharge and its application to all customers, including DA customers, because of the \"emergency\" nature of the situation and because it was \"temporary.\"\n2. The 3 cent surcharge was approved by the CPUC in the March 27 order. Once again, AReM had protested its application to DA customers. This time the CPUC explicitly exempted DA customers and stated that the surcharge was for generation-related costs going forward. The CPUC also made the one cent surcharge permanent but did not address its application to DA customers -- therefore, in my view, the earlier decision still stands on that issue. As AReM had suggested, the CPUC also stated that DA Customers would NOT be billed for the surcharge NOR given any credit for it.\n3. The March order required the utilities to file Advice Letters to implement the surcharges. This was done in April (I think) but the SCE and PG&E took two different approaches. SCE, because of billing system limitations, decided to violate the CPUC order in its implementation -- it billed DA customers for BOTH surcharges but then gave them a CREDIT that included both surcharges. PG&E, on the other hand, did NOT charge DA customers for the 3 cent surcharge nor include it in any credit -- in compliance with the CPUC March order. However, PG&E continued to charge the 1 cent surcharge to DA customers in compliance with the CPUC's January order.\n4. AReM filed comments/protests on the utility advice letters -- in May, I believe. AReM supported SCE's approach for not charging the 1 cent surcharge and for looking the closest to a \"bottoms-up\" calculation. AReM did mention that SCE should NOT be charging then crediting the surcharges, however. AReM supported PG&E's approach of neither charging nor crediting the surcharge -- but opposed PG&E's continued charging of the 1 cent surcharge. AReM agreed with SCE that, given the discussion in the March order and the application of the surcharges to generation-related costs going forward, the 1 cent surcharge should NOT apply to DA customers.\n5. When Advice Letters are protested, the Energy Division staff of the CPUC prepares a Resolution that recommends how to address the protested issues. The Resolution is then presented to the CPUC at a meeting and voted on. Usually we have between one day and one week to see the Resolution before it is voted on. No Resolution has come forward on these Advice Letters. The CPUC has no time requirement for when Advice Letters must be resolved.\n6. Discussions between AReM members and the Energy Division staff indicate that the staff agrees with AReM and will support AReM's request when it drafts the Resolution.\n7. Initiating a formal change to the January order on the 1 cent surcharge would require the filing of a Petition to Modify (usually done within a year -- but I believe can be requested at any time thereafter with a special motion). This would begin a formal process -- also WITH NO TIME LINE. It would also bring out the big guns opposing direct access -- the unions and TURN (a supposed small customer advocacy group) -- making quick response and a win for AReM more problematic.\n8. AReM has decided to work with the Energy Division staff and see if we can get a favorable Resolution kicked out by the end of September. (The Energy Division staff is overloaded right now with all the DWR-related decisions required for the 8/23 meeting.) If not, AReM will consider making a formal Petition to Modify.\n9. I recommend that Enron continue with its current strategy to work through AReM to achieve a favorable outcome on the 1 cent surcharge.\nSue Mara\n(415) 782-7802"}]

As an initial caveat, we have \nprepared this as the scrivener for the Group. Like the rest of the Group, we \nhave not specifically reviewed the substance of this with our client and we \nreserve the right to suggest changes based on our client's comments, as we \nexpect the rest of the Group will. In addition, we have the following \ncomments:\n1. In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of \npreparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the \npreliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant \ngeneral relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action. It seems \nto us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should \nproceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking \nfurther relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve \nthe charge-back issues. Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to \naddress this issue in the response. The Group may want to consider \napproaching Debtor's counsel on this issue.\n2. Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 22 proceeding \nas part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief. We have tried \nto soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is \nsimply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete \nrelief as part of the Debtor's motion. If the Debtor objects to the expanded \nrelief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically \nthe subject of the motion. We probably need to lobby Debtor's counsel to \nhelp get this accomplished without the requirement of filing an additional \nmotion for relief.\n3. Check Exhibit A to make sure that all parties are listed and the \nappropriate counsel is listed. I am trying to simply list the \"bankruptcy\" \ncounsel so that Debtor's counsel knows initially who to contact if there is \nany question relative to a party. We have not intentionally left anybody \noff. If someone is missing, it is inadvertent and we will certainly add them \nto the list.\nIf there are others of your Group who should receive this, please forward it \nto the other members of group.\nWe have set up a conference call at 12:15 E.T. to discuss this matter. The \ndial-in number is 1-800-569-0883. The confirmation number is 5096040.

The initial estimated cost to resolve all discrepancies was around $250,000. After our talks with SSEP on September 19, 2000, adjustments in staffing and enhanced productivity in addressing the discrepancies have occurred. Currently, we believe SSEP has about $35,000 remaining to rectify, and we anticipate completion by September 30, 2000. Please be aware that this summary does not include the discrepancy we identified regarding Enclosure Area Classification related to gas migration. We estimate the correction will cost about $2,000 per unit ($48,000 total). Our engineering team is reviewing this now, and we expect to have an update next week.  \nIf you need any further assistance, feel free to reach me at 713-646-8258.  \nMatthew Tezyk  \nProject Manager  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Matthew Tezyk/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 09/22/2000 11:53 AM ---------------------------  \n\nEnron Engineering & Construction Company  \nFrom: Frank R Cervenka 09/21/2000 01:47 PM  \n\nTo: armstrongm604@cs.com  \ncc: Matthew Tezyk/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, michael.storm@ss.ps.ge.com  \nSubject: Revised Enron Discrepancy list  \n[End of text]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDate: Mon, 25 Sep 2000 08:00:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: kay.mann@enron.com\nTo: ben.jacoby@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Updated Enron Discrepancy list\nBody: \nPretty small stuff from a dollar standpoint.

He asked if I wanted to talk about it, but I just kept quiet and uttered, \"Why don't you ask?\" He closed everything and quietly asked, \"What happened that made you feel this way?\" I instantly opened up and told him it hurt me, and I knew it shouldn't have because my life is more important, and I was learning in therapy how to become a better person. He just replied, \"Are you sad about it?\" And I replied, \"Not sad, disappointed, I don't want people to go down a bad path and others don't even understand it's not okay and support it, and I'm always the odd one out.\" He just repeated saying, \"Shouldn't\" is a strong word you used, it's fine to feel that way, you should take your time. He was like, \"Trust me, you're just 21 now, by the time you're 27, you'll be the one who will have your life under control where others wouldn't and I understand that's because you understand well.\" He also told me I don't fit in or isolate myself because I understand people too well and most people don't like it. I just perked up and told him, \"So what? I love being this way\" and he was like, yeah, that's important.

[{"role": "user", "content": " I truly wasn't anticipating much, aside from a few chuckles, which would have been fine for a Dreamworks animated film. However, KUNG FU PANDA surpassed all my expectations. The plot is straightforward, yet the execution is outstanding. It would be quite challenging to find anything to enhance the production. The voice performances are excellent, especially Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is incredibly vibrant, and the colors are sharp and vivid. The action sequences are exhilarating. The humor is well-timed and integrated into the right moments. The theater was packed, featuring a blend of adults and young children. This is a movie that everyone can enjoy. A testament to this is that nearly the entire audience remained for the end credits. This is a very uncommon occurrence these days. \n\nOh... and I hope this doesn't count as a spoiler.

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nTo make a delicious chipotle dish, start by chipping 7 ounces of chipotle chilies in adobo sauce (you can reduce this amount and taste and test while adding more or it will blow your eyes out). \n\nNext, combine 2 teaspoons of lime juice, 12 cups of mayonnaise, 14 cups of finely chopped cilantro, kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper, and vegetable oil (about 2 quarters or enough to have a 3-inch depth in the pot) in a blender. \n\nAdd 1 lime, its juice, 2 cups of water, 1 cup of all-purpose flour, and 1 cup of panko breadcrumbs to the blender. Blend the mixture until smooth, then set it aside. \n\nPlace the mayonnaise in a medium bowl. Whisk in one-third of the chipotle mixture at a time, tasting between each addition for spiciness (you may not want to use all of the chipotle puree). Add cilantro and season with salt and pepper. \n\nCover the mixture with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. \n\nWhile the mixture is chilling, heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over high heat until it reaches 350 degrees. \n\nIn three separate shallow dishes, mix together the all-purpose flour, lime juice mixed with 2 cups of water, and panko breadcrumbs. Cut an avocado into quarters lengthwise. Remove the wedges from the pit and peel off the skin. Cut each quarter in half so you have 8 wedges in total. Season with salt and pepper. \n\nDredge the avocado wedges in flour, then dip into lime water, and finally dredge through breadcrumbs. Make sure each slice is completely coated. \n\nOnce the oil has reached 350 degrees, fry the breaded avocado slices for about 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove the avocado from the oil using a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. \n\nServe the avocado with lime wedges and chipotle remoulade."}, {"role": "assistant",

A promising approach to achieving this is through hybrid matter-optical systems, which utilize an ancilla as a central hub to connect qubits. Our research demonstrates that by generating smaller cluster components, known as \"Lego bricks,\" and reusing the same ancilla for each brick, we can produce the cluster with maximum efficiency. This method requires fewer than half the operations needed without reusing the ancilla. By reducing the time required to prepare sections of the cluster, reusing the ancilla enables the creation of a larger computational workspace before decoherence effects become dominant.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Controversy and Lawrence Dallaglio have consistently been intertwined throughout his illustrious international career. The conclusion of his nine-year journey came unexpectedly, just four days prior to the season's kickoff. However, Dallaglio has always been an independent spirit. Since his debut on the international stage, Dallaglio has divided opinions. For England supporters, he could do no wrong. A vital component of a successful era for England, Dallaglio's pinnacle moment was his contribution to the team that clinched the Rugby World Cup in 2003. \n\nConversely, rival fans have often held a different perspective, viewing Dallaglio as a representation of the less favorable traits of English rugby. Unafraid to voice his opinions\u2014whether to the referee or opponents on the field, or to his coach and the media off it\u2014Dallaglio has occasionally rubbed people the wrong way. He made his mark as part of the underrated England squad that surprisingly won the inaugural Rugby Sevens World Cup in 1993. It took him another two years to join the full England XV, but once he did, he quickly proved his worth. Demonstrating maturity and physical strength beyond his years, Dallaglio swiftly became a first-choice player capable of excelling in any of the three back-row positions at the international level.\n\nWithin two years of his debut, Dallaglio was given the England captaincy, and his career continued to flourish as he participated in the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Although he was passed over for the captaincy in favor of his England teammate Martin Johnson, he played a crucial role in the 2-1 series victory. However, after gaining what seemed like unstoppable momentum, Dallaglio's career faced a significant setback in 1999. \n\nFirst, there was the last-minute loss to Wales, where Dallaglio's choice not to kick for goal in the final moments was blamed for costing England a Grand Slam. Things worsened when a notorious newspaper sting led to the loss of his cherished England captaincy. With sensational drug use allegations\u2014of which he was later exonerated\u2014making headlines, a devastated Dallaglio stepped down as captain. Nevertheless, he made a comeback, focusing on club-level performance before rejoining the England squad, now as a deputy to the new captain Johnson. As part of a revamped England team on the long path to World Cup success\u2014one not without its share of missed Grand Slam opportunities\u2014Dallaglio re-emerged as a key player.\n\nAnother challenge arose in 2001 when a severe knee injury curtailed Dallaglio's participation in the Lions tour to Australia. Rumors began to circulate about the end of his career, but in true Dallaglio fashion, he committed to an intense rehabilitation regimen, returning as an even more formidable athlete. The injury did diminish his speed, but ever the realist, he adapted his game to become a top-tier close-quarters number eight.\n\nAs the only player to participate in every minute of England's World Cup victory in Australia, Dallaglio did everything possible to secure England's historic win, earning him lasting admiration from England fans. Following Johnson's retirement, Dallaglio's career came full circle when Woodward reinstated him as England captain. Although England did not reach the same heights during Dallaglio's second term as captain, losing five of their eight Tests after the World Cup, he led by example, remaining one of the few squad members to meet expectations in a team lacking many World Cup stars. Dallaglio departs from international rugby knowing he will be remembered as one of England's most skilled players, if not one of its greatest captains, despite his evident pride in leading his country.\n\nThe challenge for England now lies in finding a replacement for the nearly irreplaceable Dallaglio. Names like Matt Dawson, Jonny Wilkinson, Phil Vickery, and Hill have all been suggested as potential candidates for the captaincy. However, it is in terms of his playing ability that England will truly struggle to fill the void left by the 32-year-old. While players like Joe Worsley and Chris Jones are certainly capable of stepping up, the absence of a standout candidate highlights Dallaglio's immense impact on English rugby."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nControversy and Lawrence Dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career.\nEven the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue, just four days before the start of the season. But then Dallaglio has always been his own man. Ever since emerging onto the international scene Dallaglio has polarised opinions. To supporters of England, Dallaglio could do no wrong. An integral part of a sustained period of success for England, Dallaglio's crowning glory was his part in the side that won the Rugby World Cup in 2003.\nRival fans, meanwhile, have tended to take an alternative view, seeing Dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of English rugby. Never afraid to speak his mind, be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch, or his coach or the media off it, Dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. Dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded England side which became the shock winners of the first Rugby Sevens World Cup in 1993. It took him another two years to graduate to the full England XV, but once there he proved to the manor born. Displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years, Dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard.\nWithin two years of his debut, Dallaglio was offered the England captain's band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of England team-mate Martin Johnson, he played a massive role in the 2-1 series victory. But after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, Dallaglio's career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.\nFirst came the last-minute defeat to Wales in which Dallaglio's decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing England a Grand Slam. Worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured England captaincy. With sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages, a devastated Dallaglio stepped down as England skipper. But he bounced back, getting his head down at club level before returning to the England fold, albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain Johnson. As a member of a new-look England side on the long road to World Cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of Grand Slams opportunities were spurned - Dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.\nYet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short Dallaglio's involvement on the Lions tour to Australia.\nRumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical Dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. One effect of the injury was to rob Dallaglio of much of his pace, but ever the pragmatist, he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre.\nThe only player to play every minute of England's World Cup triumph in Australia, Dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure England's historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by England supporters. Following Johnson's retirement, Dallaglio's career came full circle as Woodward restored him as England captain. While England did not hit the heights in Dallaglio's second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post-World Cup Tests, Dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many World Cup stars to live up to expectations. Dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of England's most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.\nThe problem now for England is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. The likes of Matt Dawson, Jonny Wilkinson, Phil Vickery and Hill have all been mentioned as contenders for Dallaglio's role as captain. But it is as a player that England will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old. Although players like Joe Worsley and Chris Jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about Dallaglio's massive influence on English rugby."}]

ways.\nThose tattered flags, with the door now open,\nSeemed to recall the old battles of the past,\nWhile the fallen fragments danced on the floor\nLike dead leaves in December.\nThe startled bats

[{"role": "user", "content": " U.S. lawmakers are advocating for a stringent new regulation designed to tackle indecency and inappropriate language on American television. Penalties of up to $500,000 (\u00a3266,582) could be enforced each time broadcasters air nudity or profanity. The initiative, revealed in the House of Representatives, also aims to revoke a broadcaster's license after three violations have occurred. The exposure of Janet Jackson's breast during last year's Super Bowl resulted in CBS facing a $550,000 (\u00a3293,264) fine. Entertainers could also be held accountable for fines under the proposed legislation from both U.S. politicians and officials from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A Republican senator from Kansas, Sam Brownback, is expected to propose a maximum fine of $3 million (\u00a31.6 million) for repeated offenses. \n\nThe current maximum fine is set at $32,500 (\u00a317,320) \u2014 20 of the stations in the CBS network were each penalized lesser amounts for the Jackson incident. Republican politician Fred Upton, who chairs the committee responsible for broadcasting, stated that current fines are \"more of a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent.\" Last year's Janet Jackson 'wardrobe malfunction' prompted the FCC to consider implementing stricter regulations, but the U.S. Congress adjourned last year without reaching an agreement on a new fine structure. New figures must be established before new legislation can be presented to President Bush. Certain broadcasters, like Fox, argue that the content they air does not breach indecency laws and is protected under the right to free speech."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " After the wizard Rincewind has plummeted from the edge of the Discworld, the Octavo magic book saves his life, allowing him to return to the world. Meanwhile, the wizards of Ankh-Morpork learn from Death through a rite that the Discworld is on the verge of destruction by a massive red star unless the eight spells of the Octavo are read: the most potent spells in existence, one of which is concealed within Rincewind's mind. Consequently, several orders of wizards attempt to capture Rincewind, led by Trymon, a former classmate of Rincewind's, who desires to harness the power of the spells for himself. After Rincewind, who has reunited with Twoflower, escapes them, it becomes clear that Great A'Tuin, the giant turtle that carries the Discworld, has set a new course that leads it directly into a red star with eight moons. Rincewind and Twoflower are joined by Cohen the Barbarian, a toothless, aging hero, and Bethan, a sacrificial virgin saved by Cohen, with assistance from Rincewind and Twoflower. Rincewind becomes one of the very few individuals to enter Death's Domain while still alive, where he finds Twoflower engaged in a card game with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. He is nearly killed when he encounters Death's adopted daughter Ysabelle, but is rescued by the quick-acting Luggage. The group also meets individuals who, anticipating the apocalypse, are heading for the mountains (not for protection, but because they believe they will have a better view). Additionally, they stumble upon a type of shop where strange and sinister goods are for sale and inexplicably vanish the next time a customer tries to find them. The existence of these shops is explained as a curse placed by a sorcerer on the shopkeeper for not having anything in stock. As the star approaches and the magic on the Discworld weakens, Trymon attempts to implant the seven spells still in the Octavo into his mind, in a bid to save the world and gain ultimate power. However, the spells prove too powerful for him, and his mind becomes a gateway into the \"Dungeon Dimensions,\" from which bizarre, terrifying creatures attempt to escape into reality. The seven leading wizards are meanwhile turned to stone. After winning a battle against them, Rincewind is able to read all eight spells aloud; whereupon the eight moons of the red star crack open and reveal eight tiny world-turtles that follow their parent A'Tuin on a course away from the star. The Octavo then falls and is consumed by Twoflower's Luggage. The book concludes with Twoflower and Rincewind parting company, as Twoflower decides to return home, leaving The Luggage with Rincewind as a parting gift."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Upon returning to the station, Nicola meets a new student, Esther Frewen, who has been sent to boarding school due to her parents' divorce. Esther is more concerned about leaving her puppy, Daks, behind than about her new surroundings. A few weeks into term, Nicola is shocked to discover that she's been left out of the Junior Netball team, a decision orchestrated by Lois Sanger, Nicola's long-time rival and the school's Games Captain. Although Nicola does get to be a soloist in the Christmas Play, she doesn't find it much consolation. During the half-term break, Nicola and her friend Patrick sneak away to visit Wade Minster, where they admire the carved falcon and enjoy a thrilling ride back over the downs. Meanwhile, back at school, Nicola is given the part of Shepherd Boy in the Christmas Play, a role that Lawrie desperately wanted. Lawrie believes that this is a betrayal of the highest order. However, when Lawrie injures her leg and can't participate in a netball match, Nicola comes up with a plan. She agrees to pretend to be Lawrie so that the team can win the match, which they do with ease. Lawrie is now convinced that she'll be the one playing the Shepherd Boy. On the day of the Play, Esther disappears, leaving a note for Nicola. Esther has gone home to prevent her mother from getting rid of Daks. Nicola, Lawrie, and their friends Tim and Miranda come up with a new plan, where Nicola will sing and Lawrie will act. Miranda, who is Jewish, agrees to fill the spare place in the procession. The staff at the Minster are shocked when they discover what's happened, and there's a sense of impending chaos. However, no one can think of a better plan. Everyone, including Grandmother and Patrick, is amazed by Nicola's singing and Lawrie's acting.

Returning to the station, she finds a new girl, Esther Frewen. Esther's parents are divorced and have sent her to boarding school because she doesn't quite fit in their new lives. She is not too worried about this, but mainly about leaving her puppy, Daks, behind.

Half-term is less fun than expected, mainly because Mrs Marlow's mother is visiting.

Back at school, Nicola finds that she has been given the part of Shepherd Boy in the Christmas Play, the part Lawrie desperately wanted. Lawrie thinks this is treachery on a grand scale. However, when she falls and hurts her leg so that she cannot play in a netball match, she finds a possible solution.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nFluorescence microscopy images are made up of multiple channels, each representing a specific marker that has been applied to the sample. Given the wide variety of marker combinations used in practice, it has been difficult to apply deep learning-based segmentation models. These models typically require a predefined channel combination for both training and inference. Recent research has attempted to overcome this limitation by using a modality attention approach, which allows for effective segmentation across any possible marker combination. However, this approach still has a major drawback: it is unable to provide any estimate of segmentation quality when encountering a marker combination that does not exist in the labeled training dataset. This lack of quality assurance not only makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of the model but also hinders the allocation of additional resources for imaging and labeling. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that estimates segmentation quality on unlabeled images by (i) quantifying both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties of convolutional neural networks for image segmentation, and (ii) training a Random Forest model to interpret uncertainty features via regression to their corresponding segmentation metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating these uncertainty measures into the training process can lead to improved segmentation performance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nFluorescence microscopy images contain several channels, each indicating a\nmarker staining the sample.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nSet in 18th-century France and Louisiana, the story revolves around the heroic Chevalier des Grioux and his beloved Manon Lescaut. Born into a noble and wealthy family, des Grioux forgoes his inheritance and incurs his father's disappointment by running away with Manon. In Paris, the young lovers enjoy a blissful cohabitation, but des Grioux struggles to satisfy Manon's desire for luxury. He resorts to borrowing from his loyal friend Tiberge and cheating gamblers to make ends meet. However, his wealth frequently evaporates, prompting Manon to leave him for a richer man due to her inability to tolerate poverty.\n\nThe couple eventually settles in New Orleans, where the absence of social class differences allows them to live in idyllic peace for a while. However, when des Grioux reveals their unmarried status to the Governor and asks to be wed to Manon, the Governor's nephew sets his sights on winning her hand. In desperation, des Grioux challenges the Governor's nephew to a duel and knocks him unconscious.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Matagarup Refugee Camp serves as a political demonstration against the Western Australian Government's intention to shut down numerous Aboriginal remote communities and provide a safe space for Noongar homeless individuals. Matagarup is the Noongar term for Heirisson Island, located in the heart of Perth. On March 1, 2015, over 100 Aboriginal protesters and homeless individuals set up a \"refugee protest\" camp on Heirisson Island in response to the State Government's threat of enforced closures of small remote communities. The City of Perth Shire has denied the protesters the right to camp, protest, and shelter the homeless. Between March and August 2015, the City of Perth conducted nine raids on the island camp, typically accompanied by a significant police presence, confiscating the tents and belongings of the campers and the homeless. During some of these raids, police have been accused of \"excessive use of force.\" Some of the raids resulted in police arresting campers, issuing move-on notices, and court appearances, but the campers and the homeless continue to return. Each time, the camp has re-established itself, led by Nyungah Elder Bella Bropho, who has been camping on the island since March 1, 2015. Bropho stated that the homeless camp had to be defended \"because if this fails, I don't know where the people are going to go.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.\nCalifornia demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.\n``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.\nWELCOME\nNew Hires\nEGM - Gary Denton, Luisa Rivera, Marc Graubach, Tassio Carvalho\nEIM - Sally Bailey, Scott Royster, John Gwaltney, Shawn Mejdrich, \nENA - Trenton Johnson, Kimberley Jacobson, Purvi Patel, Dale Furrow, John LaBorde, John Morris\nTransfers (to or within)\nENA - Monica Brown, Rahul Seksaria, Ofelia Morales, Francis McGuinness, George Phillips, Greg Branan, Jeffrey Bartlett, Mark Dypiangco, Ronald Williams, Russell Woody, William Loving, Cynthia Simon, Deann Hogan, Kathy Bass, LaDonna Finnels-Neal\nEGM - Michael L.

The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:\n- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, \n- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry\n- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.\nThe authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start. However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.\n \"This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000,\" says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team. \"We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities.\"\nGasMarktFax Stirs \"Trouble\" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market\nFollowing on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market: \nEuropean Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October. The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers. \"Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs,\" said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative. \"However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position. Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice,\" Helge-Jurgen added.\nEnron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland\nEnron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.\nThe 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.\nThe deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.\n\"This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland,\" declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.\n\"This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland,\" adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office. A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible.\"\nEBS Celebrates Neos Deal\nCongratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.\n \nMarcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: \"We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices.\"\nLaunch of Nordic precipitation index\nIn another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations. The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity. Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers. The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions. For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall. The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).\nOn the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region. \nGiven the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market. In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years). The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.\nLEGAL STUFF\nThe information contained in this newsletter is confidential and proprietary to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries.

In retaliation, she seeks Humphrey's assistance to embarrass Phoebe and evicts a tenant so that James can occupy a room in her home, seemingly to exert control over him. Meanwhile, during his travels, James has been involved with an American named Ned, who arrives in London to meet Leonora. Ned deceives James into abandoning Leonora, only to spurn him for another. James tries to mend their relationship, but Leonora is hesitant to give him another opportunity to hurt her and instead opts for the affection of the less appealing Humphrey.

These riders contain representations and warranties concerning the agent's authority, along with an acknowledgment from the principal regarding the same. I suggest that you all take the attached riders into account when formulating master agreements in an agency context.  \nIf the counterparty is open to it, I strongly recommend that you propose the principal sign the contract on its own behalf, with the contract simply stating that the agent is authorized to conduct transactions under the agreement for and on behalf of the principal. This is the strategy I plan to pursue with GPU. If an agent represents several principals, attempt to establish a separate master agreement with each principal. However, if the counterparty is completely against this approach, at the very least, I would include the riders and obtain acknowledgments from the principal(s). If there are multiple principals, strive to secure a distinct agreement with the agent for each principal (rather than a single master with an agent representing multiple principals) to prevent any confusion regarding transaction allocation and credit risks.  \nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.  \nI have also attached a memorandum I prepared previously that outlines various considerations when managing an agency relationship.  \nLeslie  "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDate: Mon, 4 Dec 2000 04:51:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: leslie.hansen@enron.com\nTo: debra.perlingiere@enron.com, jeffrey.hodge@enron.com, dan.hyvl@enron.com\nSubject: Agency Riders\nBody: \nCc: tana.jones@enron.com, mark.taylor@enron.com, sara.shackleton@enron.com, \n\tbrent.hendry@enron.com, alan.aronowitz@enron.com, \n\tharry.collins@enron.com, mary.cook@enron.com, \n\tstacy.dickson@enron.com, wayne.gresham@enron.com, \n\tmichael.robison@enron.com, marcus.nettelton@enron.com, \n\tjohn.viverito@enron.com, carol.clair@enron.com\nBcc: tana.jones@enron.com, mark.taylor@enron.com, sara.shackleton@enron.com, \n\tbrent.hendry@enron.com, alan.aronowitz@enron.com, \n\tharry.collins@enron.com, mary.cook@enron.com, \n\tstacy.dickson@enron.com, wayne.gresham@enron.com, \n\tmichael.robison@enron.com, marcus.nettelton@enron.com, \n\tjohn.viverito@enron.com, carol.clair@enron.com\nDebra:\nAs Debra and I discussed, we are currently preparing a GISB contract for GPU \nServices Company, as agent for ______.

[{"role": "user", "content": " A murder in 17th-century Oxford is depicted through the conflicting perspectives of four characters, all of whom serve as unreliable narrators. The story unfolds in 1663, shortly after the monarchy's restoration following the English Civil War, during a time when King Charles II's authority is still being established, and conspiracies are rampant. Most of the characters are based on historical figures. Two of the narrators are the mathematician John Wallis and the historian Anthony Wood. Other characters include the philosopher John Locke, the scientists Robert Boyle and Richard Lower, the spy master John Thurloe, and the inventor Samuel Morland. Initially, the plot focuses on the death of Robert Grove but later expands to include the conspiracies of John Mordaunt and William Compton (of Compton Wynyates), as well as the political maneuvers of Henry Bennet and Lord Clarendon. Additionally, the fictional characters are nonetheless inspired by real events. The narrative of Sarah Blundy intertwines with that of Anne Greene, while Jack Prestcott is involved in events drawn from the life of Richard Willis (of the Sealed Knot). The book is an epistolary novel. The accounts are penned many years after the events they recount, following Thomas Ken gaining his bishopric but before the death of Henry Bennet. This places them in 1685, the final year of Charles' reign. A contrasting portrayal in the novel is, on one hand, a philosophy rooted in ancient and medieval learning, and, on the other, the scientific method that was beginning to be applied in physics,

[{"role": "user", "content": " The following text is a repetitive sequence of the word \"Money\" with varying levels of indentation. It appears to be a deliberate attempt to convey a sense of abundance or excess, but its meaning is unclear without further context.\n\nThe text begins with a single line of \"Money\" repeated multiple times, followed by lines with increasing indentation. This pattern continues for several lines, with the indentation decreasing and increasing in a seemingly random manner.\n\nThe text then repeats this pattern several times, with the same sequence of indentation and repetition of the word \"Money\". The overall effect is one of monotony and repetition, with the word \"Money\" becoming increasingly meaningless as it is repeated ad infinitum.\n\nWithout further context or explanation, it is difficult to say what the author intended to convey with this text. However, it is possible that the author was attempting to make a point about the excesses of capitalism or the devaluation of money in modern society.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Sakaida Kakiemon, also known as Sakaida Kizaemon (1596 \u2014 1666), was a Japanese potter who created the style that later became known as Kakiemon. He collaborated with Higashijima Toku\u00e9 and was responsible for producing the first enameled porcelain in Japan. Biography Sakaida Kakiemon began his porcelain business after the decline of the Ming dynasty in China, which led to the disruption of traditional Chinese porcelain exports to Europe. It is said that Sakaida Kakiemon learned the technique of enameled porcelain from a Chinese artisan in Nagasaki in 1643. He was the first in Japan to practice overglaze enameling (applying enamel on top of the glazing), a technique that originated in China during the Kangxi era of the Qing dynasty. He also improved the method for creating a translucent white glaze, known as nigoshide. In the Arita dialect, nigoshide describes the water used to wash rice, thus referring to the translucent white of nigoshide. In contrast to other Arita ware, which often has a bluish tint, nigoshide exhibits virtually no bluish cast."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": "... LET\u2019S DISCUSS The 77th Annual Academy Awards will take place on February 27, and actors from around the globe will once again be on edge to find out who will take home the honors this year. But how did this event evolve from its humble origins? The inaugural Academy Awards were held in 1929 at a relatively simple dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, located just a short distance from its current location. At that time, around 250 guests were present, and tickets were priced at just $5. The first best picture award was given to \u201cWings,\u201d a silent film featuring Clara Bow. For nearly a decade afterward, the names of the winners were disclosed to newspapers at 11 p.m. However, in 1940, the Los Angeles Times published the winners' names at 8:30 p.m., meaning that even those at the ceremony were aware of the results beforehand. This controversy led to the implementation of the sealed envelope system, creating the suspenseful event we know today. The ceremony continued to be held at a dinner until 1942, when it became impractical to host the awards in a hotel. The event was then relocated to a theater, with the famous Chinese Theater being the first to accommodate the larger gathering. The awards were also presented at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Shrine Auditorium, but they are currently held at the 6,500-seat Kodak Theatre, which opened across the street from the original site in 2002. From 1929 until 1954, the awards ceremony took place on Thursdays, then shifted to Mondays and Wednesdays before finally settling on Sunday nights. The date has varied each year, moving from May to April, then to March, and now to February. The first televised ceremony occurred in 1953, hosted by Bob Hope. The origin of the name \u201cOscar\u201d is somewhat unclear. A common theory is that academy librarian Margaret Herrick commented that the statuette resembled her Uncle Oscar, and a journalist overheard her remark and used the name in an article. It is believed that the first instance of the word \u201cOscar\u201d appearing in print was in a column by Sidney Skolsky, reviewing Hepburn\u2019s first win in 1934. The name became widely accepted, and in 1939, the Academy officially adopted it. The statuette was crafted by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons, and since the awards began, 2,550 Oscars have been awarded. During World War II, the statuette was made of zinc instead of gold, but once the war ended, the material was switched back to gold. In 2000, fifty-five golden statuettes were stolen en route to the ceremony, but after nine days, fifty-four were recovered. The originals were destroyed, and new ones were quickly produced. The academy was established in 1927 as a non-profit organization, initially with 36 members from various sectors of the film industry. After the first ceremony in 1929, the membership grew to 1,099, and today it stands at 5,670. New members are invited on an invitation-only basis, with criteria for acceptance including film credits that meet the academy's high standards, having been nominated for an Oscar, receiving special merit, and making significant contributions to the industry. While the Academy has honored many of the most significant films and filmmakers, several classics have emerged without receiving nominations, such as Hobson\u2019s Choice, Dirty Harry, The 39 Steps, King Kong, and Homage to the Wind. Numerous actors have also been overlooked, including Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer in 1927, Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca in 1944, Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain in 1952, and Henry Fonda in Twelve Angry Men in 1957. Many others, including Alfred Hitchcock, despite five nominations, were never acknowledged for their contributions to the horror genre. However, in 1968, he received an honorary Oscar for his extensive work in that field. The glamorous event has never been interrupted by a single war. There were calls to cancel the 2003 ceremony due to the Iraq war, but since the event had continued during World War II and the Vietnam War, it proceeded. Nevertheless, Michael Moore, nominated for best documentary, used his speech to speak out against the American invasion. The ceremony itself was subdued, with many women opting for dark dresses. During World War II, the ceremony was postponed only three times. In 1938, it was delayed for a week due to a significant flood, and two days were added to the schedule to honor Martin Luther King Jr. The ceremony was also postponed for twenty-four hours in tribute to President Reagan, who had just been shot. Subsequently, George C. Scott declined to accept his Oscar in protest, claiming it was all a farce. In 1935, writer Dudley Nichols rejected his award for writing The Inside Man due to a strike by the Writers Guild of America. In 1973, Marlon Brando refused to accept"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nLET\u2019S DISCUSS The 77th Annual Academy Award event will be held on February 27, and movie stars all over the world will be on tenterhooks once again to see who will win the awards this year.

In 1935, writer Dudley Nichols turned down his award for writing The Inside Man because of a strike by the Writers Guild of America. In 1973 Marlon Brando refused to accept his best actor award for The Godfather in protest of the way he felt the industry was discriminating against Native Americans. Rather, he sent in an impersonator named Sacheen Littlefeather, who was a fictitious character, who was actually the actress Maria Cruz. The next year Robert Osborne turned up at the ceremony wearing only a black bathrobe, flashing a peace sign and making a number of gestures. In his acceptance speech he mentioned, among other things, the death of President Nixon. It was on that occasion that Osborne was assassinated. Then in 1934, when Frank Capra was the presenter, he opened up his envelope, said, \u201cThe winner is Frank, and the winner is...\u201d and announced, \u201cFrank Lloyd!\u201d Frank Capra immediately jumped up to the stage, only to realize it was not him but Frank Lloyd who had won for Cavalcade. Capra swore he would never attend the ceremony again, but the next year he went to accept his award for It Happened One Night."}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " The Gun Seller narrates the tale of Thomas Lang, a former Army officer who leads a somewhat precarious life in London, primarily preoccupied with consuming whisky and riding his motorcycle. His earnings come from various roles as a bodyguard, enforcer, and mercenary, leveraging the expertise and connections he acquired during his military service. When approached in Amsterdam by a man requesting him to kill American businessman Alexander Woolf, Lang tries to alert Woolf at his Belgravia residence, only to find Woolf absent and instead confronts (and subdues) a mercenary, later meeting Woolf's daughter, Sarah. Subsequently, Lang finds himself under close observation from both the Ministry of Defence and the Central Intelligence Agency, who assert that Woolf is an international drug trafficker currently being investigated. Curious about the sudden attention from two government entities, Lang sets out to locate the man who contacted him in Amsterdam, unexpectedly discovering him in London, and even more surprisingly, realizing that the man is Alexander Woolf himself. Eventually, Woolf and his daughter agree to dine with Lang to address his inquiries. The elder Woolf reveals that he sought to hire Lang as a hitman to assess his character and acknowledges that he is under investigation, but not for drug trafficking. Instead, Woolf is of interest due to his knowledge of a next-generation light attack helicopter. More alarmingly, Woolf and Sarah assert that a conspiracy is in motion to orchestrate a terrorist attack and subsequently promote the light helicopter by deploying it to eliminate the terrorists. Lang is doubtful, but begins to accept the narrative after he is kidnapped and interrogated about Woolf. He manages to escape, discovering a severely tortured Alexander Woolf in a nearby room. Woolf is killed shortly after as Lang flees, taking out his captors in the process. With Sarah missing and now convinced the conspiracy is genuine, Lang seeks to identify the main conspirators, assisted by a friend of Sarah's named Ronnie. After some investigation, he focuses on a CIA Deputy Director named Barnes, who forcibly brings him to meet the chief conspirator: billionaire Naimh Murdah. Murdah, the owner of the helicopter manufacturing company, openly acknowledges the scheme and bluntly states that Lang will be involved in executing the terrorist attack, reinforcing his statement with a direct threat to Sarah's life. To emphasize his point, Murdah casually kills a CIA agent who accompanied Lang and Barnes to his residence. Lang is integrated into a small terrorist group called the Sword of Justice as a Minnesotan named Ricky, officially to gather intelligence and reduce casualties. A Dutch politician appears to be shot dead by Lang in Switzerland as a preliminary exercise for the Sword of Justice, although it was staged, and the politician was briefed and wearing body armor. During a brief return to London, Lang encounters Sarah and confronts her about photographs, provided by his friend and handler Solomon, showing Sarah and Barnes together. Sarah confesses to being part of the conspiracy but insists her father's death was never part of the plan. Lang and the Sword of Justice arrive in Casablanca and successfully seize control of the American embassy there, taking several hostages. Barnes, Murdah, Sarah, and other conspirators arrive in Casablanca to oversee Lang and ensure the plot's success. Lang discreetly exits the Embassy as instructed, but as Murdah speaks to him, Lang draws a gun, which Sarah had slipped to him as part of a plan they devised in London. Lang forces Murdah into the Embassy at gunpoint and handcuffs him to a fire escape on the roof, then demands he call off the helicopter attack. Murdah refuses, confident that the attack will not proceed since he is in danger, but Lang argues that the greed of the remaining conspirators will guarantee the attack goes ahead. Just as Lang anticipated, the helicopter strikes, killing one of the terrorists, but before it can make another pass, Lang shoots it down with a Javelin missile he had smuggled into the embassy earlier.

His income stems from a variety of bodyguard, strong-arm and mercenary jobs he undertakes, utilizing the skills he learned and contacts he made during his time in the Army. After being approached in Amsterdam by a man asking him to assassinate American businessman Alexander Woolf, Lang attempts to warn the intended victim at his Belgravia flat, finding Woolf gone and instead clashing with (and incapacitating) a mercenary, then encountering Woolf's daughter Sarah. Afterward Lang finds himself under intense scrutiny from both the Ministry of Defence and the Central Intelligence Agency, who claim Woolf is an international drug smuggler currently under investigation. Intrigued by the sudden interest of two government agencies, Lang attempts to track down the man who approached him in Amsterdam, unexpectedly finding him in London, and even more unexpectedly discovering that the man is Alexander Woolf himself. Eventually Woolf and his daughter agree to meet Lang at dinner and answer his questions. The elder Woolf explains that he tried to hire Lang as a hitman to see if he was a \"good man\", and admits he is under investigation, but not for selling drugs. Rather, Woolf is of interest because of what he knows about a next-generation light attack helicopter. More disturbingly, Woolf and Sarah claim that a conspiracy is under way to stage a terrorist attack and subsequently promote the light helicopter by sending one in to eliminate the terrorists. Lang is skeptical, but begins to believe the story after he is kidnapped and interrogated about Woolf. He frees himself, finding a heavily tortured Alexander Woolf in a nearby room. Woolf is killed shortly thereafter as Lang makes his escape, killing his captors in the process. With Sarah missing and now certain the conspiracy is real, Lang attempts to determine the main conspirators, aided by a friend of Sarah's named Ronnie. After some investigating he centers on a CIA Deputy Director named Barnes, who (forcibly) takes him to meet the head conspirator: billionaire Naimh Murdah. Murdah, owner of the company that manufactures the helicopter, openly admits to the plot and plainly states that Lang will be helping to carry out the terrorist attack, backing up his declaration with an open and explicit threat on Sarah's life. To illustrate his point, Murdah casually kills a CIA agent who accompanied Lang and Barnes to his home. Lang is placed within a small terrorist group called the Sword of Justice as a Minnesotan named Ricky, officially in order to gather intelligence and minimize casualties. A Dutch politician is seemingly shot dead by Lang in Switzerland as a warm up activity by the Sword of Justice, although it was a set-up and the politician was briefed and was wearing body armour. During a brief return to London Lang encounters Sarah and confronts her regarding pictures, provided to him by his friend and handler Solomon, showing Sarah and Barnes together. Sarah admits to being a part of the conspiracy, but swears her father's death was never part of the arrangement. Lang and Sword of Justice arrive in Casablanca and successfully take control of the American embassy there, holding a number of hostages. Barnes, Murdah, Sarah, and a number of other conspirators arrive in Casablanca to direct Lang and ensure the success of the plot. Lang covertly leaves the Embassy as directed, but as Murdah is talking to him Lang pulls a gun, slipped to him by Sarah as part of a plan they made in London. Lang forces Murdah into the Embassy at gunpoint and handcuffs him to a fire escape on the roof, then orders him to call off the helicopter attack. Murdah refuses, certain the attack will not come since he is in the line of fire, but Lang contends the greed of the remaining conspirators will ensure the attack goes as planned. Just as Lang predicted, the helicopter attacks, killing one of the terrorists, but before it can make another pass Lang shoots it down with a Javelin missile he smuggled into the embassy earlier. Footage of the helicopter's attack and destruction is shown worldwide via news networks covering the siege, ruining any chance of any military investing in the helicopter. Lang releases a statement (via the terrorists) to CNN outlining the conspiracy, ensuring that the plot is thwarted. The Ministry of Defence flies a tired Lang and Solomon back to England. After landing Lang is greeted by Ronnie, who managed to force the Ministry to allow her to ride with him from the airport, and makes it quite clear she is happy to see him."}]

Inside the bookstore, he meets a former teacher from his days at Meredith Academy; Leonidas Weatherall, \"the man who looks like Shakespeare,\" who had lost all his money in the 1929 stock market crash and has become the bookstore's janitor. The bookstore's new owner is a pretty young redhead who is connected to Jones' acquaintance.\n\nAfter a book thief and a car accident outside, Professor North's body is discovered in the religion section. Under Weatherall's supervision, the group, which soon includes a wealthy Boston dowager, North's sassy maid, Gertrude, and Gertrude's mobster boyfriend, Freddy, spends the evening tracking down clues to the murderer's identity and trying to stay out of the clutches of Freddy's rival gang. Under Weatherall's supervision, the group solves the murder and forces a confession from the murderer just in time to save Jones from the police."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " How individuals access their digital entertainment in the future may undergo significant changes, following the introduction of an ambitious European initiative. Last week in Nice, the European Commission unveiled its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) project. This initiative encompasses a wide range of aspects, from media creation to distribution and playback. The Commission aims to enable users to easily find the content they want and have it delivered effortlessly, whether they are on the go, at home, or at work, regardless of the device, network, content provider, or content protection method involved. Over 120 experts gathered in Nice to discuss the vision of a connected future and to hear commitments of support from companies like Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson, and Telefonica. It may seem surprising that competing companies are eager to collaborate, but speakers consistently emphasized that incompatible, isolated solutions are unlikely to succeed. A comprehensive strategy for the advancement and convergence of technologies and services will be essential. \n\nThe European Commission is taking a practical approach. They recognize that various groups have already outlined the forms of digital media relevant to the NEM initiative. The NEM strategy involves thoroughly examining existing resources and upcoming developments, selecting the best options, and identifying any gaps. When gaps are found, the initiative will create standards to address them. Notably, it is significant that such a large and influential organization has expressed its intention for digital formats to be accessible to everyone and compatible with any device. This is likely to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organizations who believe that the preferences of content rights holders are often prioritized over those of consumers. Many consider that the most challenging aspect for the Commission will be finding a solution for the various Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems. Currently, DRM solutions are incompatible, restricting certain types of purchased content and rendering them unplayable across different platforms. With the potential to capture a share of every media transaction globally, the opportunity for the provider of the leading DRM system is substantial. While entertainment is an obvious starting point, the initiative will also extend to remote healthcare services, energy efficiency, and smart home management. The 85-year plan consolidates the efforts of numerous ongoing research projects that the EC has been funding for several years. \n\nSimon Perry serves as the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website, which explores the influence of technology on media."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nHow people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change, following the launch of an ambitious European project.\nIn Nice last week, the European Commission announced its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) initiative. Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.\nThe European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes. Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home. The 85-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years.\nSimon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website, which covers the impact of technology on media"}]

He is widely recognized for his work as a songwriter and producer for the art-pop band Fol Chen, which released three albums on Sufjan Stevens's Asthmatic Kitty label between 2009 and 2013. The band's unique sound, characterized by a blend of dark and whimsical elements, earned them a dedicated following. Goldman has also been involved with other notable projects, including serving as the songwriter and singer for the chamber pop band Bedroom Walls and as a touring guitarist for Liars during their 2008 tour, which featured Radiohead as the headlining act.\n\nIn addition to his work with Fol Chen, Goldman has produced albums for Andrew Bird and Simone White, and has remixed songs by Junior Vasquez and David Bowie. He has also paid tribute to Prince by recording a cover of one of his songs for Spin magazine.

These graphs focus on risk-adjusted return, which is \ncrucial in our diverse markets with varying risk characteristics and \nEnron's differing risk appetites. To compare returns fairly, we need to \nconsider the risk involved. Our approach is to divide return by a measure \nof risk, effectively standardizing return numbers (how many dollars we \nearn for every dollar we put at risk).\n\nThe Return on VaR (ROVAR) graph displays the average daily total profit \nand loss (P&L) divided by the average daily Value at Risk (VaR) for each \nbusiness unit or commodity group. A higher ROVAR indicates better \nperformance relative to other business units. Each business unit has two \nbars: a dark blue bar on the left shows the ROVAR on a 4-week rolling \nbasis, and a light blue bar on the right shows the ROVAR on a 1-week \nrolling basis. The 1-week ROVAR is more sensitive and can fluctuate \nfrequently.\n\nThe Sharpe Ratio graph is similar in concept, showing the average daily \ncurve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard deviation. \nThis Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new deals, \nreserves, and so forth). Unlike VaR, which is a forward-looking statistic, \nstandard deviation is a backward-looking measure of actual volatility. \nEach business unit has two bars: a dark brown bar on the left showing the \nSharpe ratio on a 4-week rolling basis, and a light brown bar on the right \nshowing the ratio on a 1-week basis.\n\nThe Curve Shift P&L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other \nwell, measuring different aspects of performance. If our P&L is composed \nmostly of curve shift, and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift \nvolatility, the two statistics should be very close.\n\nTo provide a more detailed view of the actual magnitude of the P&L \nrelative to the risk, we have created the Risk - Return graphs. On the \nvertical axis, they show the 4-week rolling average P&L. On the horizontal \naxis, they show the 4-week rolling average VaR. The various business units \nare plotted as points on the graphs. These graphs are closely related to the \n4-week ROVARs, in that the vertical value of every point divided by its \nhorizontal value is the business unit's ROVAR (average P&L / average VaR). \nAnother way of looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line \nconnecting the origin (0,0) with the plotted point of a business unit is \nits ROVAR. Books with small risks and returns (< $2 million) are plotted on \nthe \"Small\" graph, and the rest, on the \"Large\".\n\nThese graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize \nand capture the information reported in the DPR. Most, but not all of the \ninformation in the DPR currently flows from the database. As a result, we \ndo not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit. As we continue \nto set up exports into the database, we will fill in the missing numbers.\n\nWe will e-mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the \nintra-net. Please remember to launch the file in Excel, instead of using \nthe Lotus Notes viewer. The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last \nweek are already on the web. We hope that you find all of these useful.\n\nRegards,\nEugenio Perez"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDate: Thu, 7 Sep 2000 10:17:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: eugenio.perez@enron.com\nTo: john.lavorato@enron.com, john.sherriff@enron.com, jeffrey.shankman@enron.com, \n\tted.murphy@enron.com, mark.frevert@enron.com, rick.buy@enron.com, \n\tsally.beck@enron.com, shona.wilson@enron.com\nSubject: Four New Graphs\nBody: \nCc: michael.moscoso@enron.com, maria.aguilera-peon@enron.com, \n\tjennifer.nguyen@enron.com\nBcc: michael.moscoso@enron.com, maria.aguilera-peon@enron.com, \n\tjennifer.nguyen@enron.com\nWe have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the \nDPR: \nReturn on VaR (ROVAR)\nCurve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio\nRisk - Return (Large)\nRisk - Return (Small)\nAll of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return. The \nmarkets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics. Furthermore, \nEnron's appetite for risk also differs in each market. As a result, it is \ndifficult to compare returns in absolute terms. Therefore, the approach of \nthese graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating \nreturn numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every \ndollar we put at risk).\n For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average \nof daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR. Higher ROVARs \nindicate better performance (relative to other business units). For each \nbusiness unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the \nleft shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light \nblue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis. \nBecause of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be \nquite high or low, and it changes frequently.\nThe Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of \ndaily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard \ndeviation. This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new \ndeals, reserves, and so forth). Furthermore, whereas VaR is a forward \nlooking statistic (the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given \nprobability), standard deviation is backward looking (the actual volatility \nof our returns over the period). This graph also has two bars for every \nbusiness unit or commodity group: a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe \nratio on a 4 week rolling basis, and a light brown on the right showing the \nratio on a 1 week basis.\nThe Curve Shift P&L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other \nwell. They measure different things, but if our P&L is composed mostly of \ncurve shift, and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility, the two \nstatistics should be very close.\nSometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the P&L relative \nto the risk. We therefore put together the Risk - Return graphs. On the \nvertical axis, they show 4 week rolling average P&L. On the horizontal, they \nshow 4 week rolling average VaR. The various business units are plotted as \npoints on the graphs. These graphs are closely related to the 4-week ROVARs, \nin that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is \nthe business unit's ROVAR (average P&L / average VaR). Another way of \nlooking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin \n(0,0) with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR. Books with \nsmall risks and returns (< $2 million) are plotted on the \"Small\" graph, and \nthe rest, on the \"Large\".\nThese graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and \ncapture the information that is reported in the DPR. Most, but not all of \nthe information in the DPR currently flows from the database. As a result, \nwe do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit. As we \ncontinue to set up exports into the database, we will fill in the missing \nnumbers.\nWe will e-mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the \nintra-net. Please remember to launch the file in Excel, instead of using the \nLotus Notes viewer. The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are \nalready on the web. We hope that you find all of these useful.\nRegards,\nEugenio Perez"}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nThe debut album by British pop singer Sandie Shaw, titled 'Sandie', was released in February 1965 on the Pye label. This was her only original album to enter the UK Albums Chart, and it peaked at number 3. Prior to the album's release, Shaw had scored two major hits with the Bacharach/David-penned \"(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me\" and Chris Andrews' \"Girl Don't Come\"; although neither track was included on this album. Andrews, who had been signed to Shaw as her main songwriter, contributed four new songs to her debut album. These tracks were later released on an EP titled \"Talk About Love.\" The other eight tracks on the Sandie album were reworkings of songs made popular by other artists. Sandie was eventually released on the CD format on the RPM label in the 1990s as a double package with her second album, Me. This package was later re-released in digitally remastered format by EMI in September 2005, with bonus French-language versions of two of the Chris Andrews tracks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

The young boy sits at a table, his head down, his clear neck exposed as he watches the drugstore sign from the tail of his eye; a tattoo, neon, until the eye blurs, while his solicitous tall sister, simple in blue, bends behind him, cutting his hair with her cheap shears.\n\nThe arrow's electric red always reaches its mark, successful neon! He coughs, impressed by that precision. His child's forehead, forever protected by his cap, is blackened against the lamp light as he turns his head and steadies to let the snips drop.\n\nErasing the failure of weeks with level fingers, she smooths the fine hair, combining: 'You'll look fine tomorrow! You'll surely find something, they can't keep turning you down; the finest gentleman's not so trim as you!' Smiling, he raises the adolescent forehead wrinkling ironical now.\n\nHe sees his decent suit laid out, new-pressed, his carfare on the shelf. He lets his head fall, meeting her earnest hopeless look, seeing the sharp blades splitting, the darkened room, the imperial sign, her motion, the blue vein, bringing on her temple, pitifully beating."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nS\u200bU\u200bN\u200bD\u200bA\u200bY\u200b \u200bs\u200bh\u200bu\u200bt\u200bs\u200b \u200bd\u200bo\u200bw\u200bn\u200b \u200bo\u200bn\u200b

Ensure the lemons are free from blemishes and wash them thoroughly to remove any pesticide residue. If purchasing, make sure to clean them properly. Begin by cutting a small portion off the top and bottom of each lemon to create a stable base. Next, stand a lemon upright and slice it lengthwise, but avoid cutting through to the bottom. Flip the lemon over and make another cut at a right angle to create a cross-section. Place one of these lemon halves at the bottom of a sterilized, wide-mouthed pint jar. Continue filling the jar with the remaining lemon halves, leaving no space and allowing the lemon juice to rise to the top. Once the jar is full, cover it and let it sit at room temperature. As the lemon rinds soften, you can replenish the jar with freshly squeezed lemon juice. After five to six weeks, the lemons will be ready to use, with tender rinds. Before consumption, rinse the lemons under cold water. Once opened, store the preserved lemons in the refrigerator for up to six months."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nPROCEDURE: Select twelve unblemished lemons from organic fruit, preferably Meyer (small).

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nThe US film industry has taken a bold step in its fight against piracy by launching lawsuits against individuals who facilitate the sharing of copyrighted movies online. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) is specifically targeting those who operate websites that provide links to pirated films, often using the popular file-sharing program BitTorrent. In a coordinated effort, the MPAA has filed lawsuits against over 100 server operators in the US and UK, as well as against users of other file-sharing programs such as eDonkey and DirectConnect in several countries, including the US, UK, France, Finland, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe MPAA's strategy is to disrupt the flow of pirated content by targeting the individuals who run websites that facilitate the sharing of copyrighted material. BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file-sharing program, allows users to download files from multiple sources simultaneously, making it a popular choice for those looking to access pirated movies. By suing the operators of these websites, the MPAA hopes to cut off the supply of pirated content and make it more difficult for users to access copyrighted material.\n\nThe film industry is taking a proactive approach to combat piracy, which has become a major concern in the wake of the rapid growth of broadband internet. With the ability to download movies quickly and easily, the industry fears that it could suffer the same downturn as the music industry, which has been severely impacted by piracy. In a recent move, major film studios launched lawsuits against 200 individuals who were sharing films online, highlighting the industry's determination to protect its intellectual property."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nThe US movie industry has launched legal action to sue people who facilitate illegal film downloading.\nThe Motion Picture Association of America wants to stop people using the program BitTorrent to swap movies. The industry is targeting people who run websites which provide information and internet links to movies which have been copied or filmed in cinemas. More than 100 server operators have been targeted in the actions launched in the US and UK, the MPAA added. The suits were filed against users of the file-sharing programs BitTorrent, eDonkey and DirectConnect in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Finland and the Netherlands, the MPAA said.\nBitTorrent users can download movies by following a link to files which are found on websites called trackers. Unlike most peer-to-peer programs BitTorrent works by sharing a file, which could be anything from a legitimate digital photo to a copied movie, among multiple users at the same time. The movie industry hopes that suing the people who run the trackers will cut BitTorrent users off from illegal movies at source. Last month major film studios started legal action against 200 individuals who were swapping films online. The growth in broadband has made it quicker for people to download movies and the industry fears that if it does not take action now, it could suffer the same downturn as the music industry."}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " As Nemo reflects on his life (from age 118, wistfully, and looking ahead from age 9, predictively, drawing from a 9-year-old's storybook-like, even horror-themed, clich\u00e9d visions of adolescent/adult existence and sci-fi future realms), he perceives that the choices he made and their anticipated outcomes fundamentally arise from one pivotal decision made at age 9, with each path \"tipped up\" as a draft of an alternate existence. It\u2019s an existential narrative about the influence of choice in shaping the environments that redefine the individuals who subsequently choose from what life offers in their ensuing settings, ad infinitum. It\u2019s a romantic story in both the historical sense of quixotic, picaresque adventures multifacetedly envisioned (including into distant times and spaces) and the contemporary sense of a quest for the idealized romance of heart and soul.\n\nThe alternate lives Nemo imagines ultimately revolve around one pursuit: the mutuality of love in marriage. There\u2019s no clich\u00e9 in that; rather, it\u2019s a truth of human desire and need born from the agonizing pain of a 9-year-old caught in a tumultuous divorce. Desperate to make a choice no 9-year-old should be asked to make, in such a way that it will be \"the right choice\" for his future, especially to find rapturous, enduring love, not to recreate his parents' fate, he engages in a daunting will to prediction and a time-travel suspension and projection that allows him to envision three futures before making the fateful choice.\n\nThus, to me, Nemo's three \"lives\" \u2013 represented by three girls and the wives they become in his predictive imaginings and remembrances \u2013 illustrate three points on the continuum of mutuality in love:\n\n\u2022 loving more than being loved (with Elise, who marries him on the 'rebound,' keeping the torch alive for the old flame)\n\n\u2022 being loved more than loving (with Jean, whom he marries as fated by a dance, thus a kind of 'arranged marriage')\n\nThese two reflect shoe-on-the-other-foot variations on the torturous \"I love you but I'm not in love\" dynamic where Nemo believes a marriage can work, only to discover it cannot.\n\n\u2022 and mutually impressed loving (with Anna)\n\nAcross scenarios, we see his one mutual love, Anna, as someone he\u2019d encounter in various contexts (as if destined, as if his scriptwriting mind is trying to relieve him of the paralyzing thought that any choice could preclude finding his true love yet also revealing that some timings for crossing paths with Anna could be inopportune, that perhaps only one timing might lead to the sustainable love life he craves):\n\nfirst as children at the beach (whom we wind back to in the final shot, sitting in innocent harmony on the dock), an age seen in first draft as too awkward for Nemo's self-consciousness that makes him hide his truth and blurt relationship-killing statements;\n\nsecond as adolescents, brought together by parental merger, a merger that eventually reinforces his 9-year-old self's pain about the fragility of imperfect love while exalting his and Anna's mutual pledges of soul-mate-like passion;\n\nthird as adults, passing in a crowd - train depot, city street, funeral - where timings are off, where too much accumulated adult pain, caution, and distrust interfere, making all but the final draft of such adult encounters \u2013 the miracle in the chalk circle \u2013 come to a dead end;\n\nand lastly as aged fellow travelers to Mars (i.e., destined to meet even if Nemo initially married Elise, upon honoring Elise's wish for her ashes).\n\nOld Nemo claiming that these depicted lives are equally \"meaningful\" doesn\u2019t imply equally nurturing or vital; his emotion betrays where his truth lies - with a mutual love that\u2019s \"to die for\" (among all the traumatic deaths - by water, fire, or firearm \u2013 that he envisions) - and at age 118 worth living for \u2013 long enough to see Time reverse and be able to wind his way back - back to the chalk circle when \"chance\" or fate or miracle rescues an all-but-lost hope of reconnection, or back further to childhood on the dock as playmate-sweethearts who might never have lost each other, perhaps the maximal dream of the 9-year-old's quest for a love that endures all change.\n\nWhen old Nemo lives long enough to reach time's reversal, he laughs a victorious laugh for having found the scenario that miraculously returns his one mutual love to him in the nick of time, now presumably together (in some time and space) \"for as long as both shall live.\"\n\nSome suggest the \"moral of the story\" carries a (negative) verdict about wealth or career. But I think it was not wealth-induced boredom that made the Nemo who married Jean seek an alternate identity that got him assassinated; rather, it was the restless boredom of never truly loving, reflected in"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n\u0410s \u039d\u0435m\u043e l\u043e\u043eks b\u0430\u0441k (fr\u043em \u0430g\u0435 118, \u0443\u0435\u0430rn\u0456ngl\u0443, \u0430nd f\u043erw\u0430rd fr\u043em \u0430g\u0435 9, \u0440r\u0435d\u0456\u0441t\u0456v\u0435l\u0443, dr\u0430w\u0456ng \u043en \u0430 9-\u0443\u0435\u0430r-\u043eld's st\u043er\u0443b\u043e\u043ek-\u0435v\u0435n-h\u043err\u043er-st\u043er\u0443-b\u0430s\u0435d \u0441l\u0456\u0441h\u00e9d \u0456m\u0430g\u0456n\u0456ngs \u043ef \u0430d\u043el\u0435s\u0441\u0435nt/\u0430dult l\u0456f\u0435 \u0430nd s\u0441\u0456-f\u0456 futur\u0435 w\u043erlds), h\u0435 s\u0435\u0435s h\u0456s l\u0456f\u0435's \u0441h\u043e\u0456\u0441\u0435s \u0430nd th\u0435\u0456r \u0435nv\u0456s\u0456\u043en\u0435d \u0441\u043ens\u0435qu\u0435n\u0441\u0435s \u0440\u0456v\u043et\u0430ll\u0443 st\u0435mm\u0456ng fr\u043em \u043en\u0435 \u0441ru\u0441\u0456\u0430l \u0441h\u043e\u0456\u0441\u0435 \u0430t \u0430g\u0435 9, \u0435\u0430\u0441h \u0440\u0430th \"t\u0443\u0440\u0435d u\u0440\" \u0430s \u0430 dr\u0430ft \u043ef \u0430n \u0430lt\u0435rn\u0430t\u0435 l\u0456f\u0435. \u0399t's \u0430n \u0435\u0445\u0456st\u0435nt\u0456\u0430l t\u0430l\u0435 \u043ef th\u0435 \u0440\u043ew\u0435r \u043ef \u0441h\u043e\u0456\u0441\u0435 t\u043e \u0441r\u0435\u0430t\u0435 th\u0435 \u0435nv\u0456r\u043enm\u0435nts th\u0430t r\u0435sh\u0430\u0440\u0435 th\u0435 \u0440\u0435rs\u043ens wh\u043e th\u0435n \u0441h\u043e\u043es\u0435 fr\u043em wh\u0430t l\u0456f\u0435 \u0440r\u0435s\u0435nts \u0456n th\u0435\u0456r \u0441\u043ens\u0435qu\u0435nt \u0435nv\u0456r\u043enm\u0435nts, \u0430d \u0456nf\u0456n\u0456tum. \u0399t's \u0430 r\u043em\u0430nt\u0456\u0441 t\u0430l\u0435 \u0456n b\u043eth th\u0435 h\u0456st\u043er\u0456\u0441 s\u0435ns\u0435 \u043ef qu\u0456\u0445\u043et\u0456\u0441, \u0440\u0456\u0441\u0430r\u0435squ\u0435 \u0430dv\u0435ntur\u0435 mult\u0456\u0440l\u0443 \u0435nv\u0456s\u0456\u043en\u0435d (\u0456n\u0441lud\u0456ng \u0456nt\u043e d\u0456st\u0430nt t\u0456m\u0435 \u0430nd s\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0435) \u0430nd th\u0435 m\u043ed\u0435rn s\u0435ns\u0435 \u043ef \u0430 qu\u0435st f\u043er th\u0435 \u0456d\u0435\u0430l\u0456z\u0435d r\u043em\u0430n\u0441\u0435 \u043ef h\u0435\u0430rt \u0430nd s\u043eul.<br/><br/>\u0422h\u0435 \u0430lt\u0435rn\u0430t\u0435 l\u0456v\u0435s \u039d\u0435m\u043e \u0435nv\u0456s\u0456\u043ens ult\u0456m\u0430t\u0435l\u0443 h\u0456ng\u0435 \u043en \u0430 qu\u0435st f\u043er \u043en\u0435 th\u0456ng: mutu\u0430l\u0456t\u0443 \u043ef l\u043ev\u0435 \u0456n m\u0430rr\u0456\u0430g\u0435. \u039d\u043e \u0441l\u0456\u0441h\u00e9 \u0456n th\u0430t; r\u0430th\u0435r \u0430 truth \u043ef hum\u0430n w\u0430nt \u0430nd n\u0435\u0435d b\u043ern\u0435 \u043eut \u043ef th\u0435 \u0430ngu\u0456sh\u0456ng \u0440\u0430\u0456n \u043ef \u0430 9-\u0443\u0435\u0430r-\u043eld \u0441\u0430ught \u0456n ru\u0440tur\u043eus d\u0456v\u043er\u0441\u0435.

For FGK-type stars, radiative transfer models are frequently developed under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). However, the reliability of this assumption is often debatable and requires thorough investigations that are based on a coherent framework of non-LTE. In this review, we present the theory of non-LTE. We qualitatively introduce the processes that lead to deviations from LTE through their physical interpretations, as well as quantitatively by examining their effects on stellar spectrum models and elemental abundances. Additionally, we gather and evaluate the latest findings from existing literature.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nNorth Asia's economic recovery is expected to continue, driven by a resurgence in public consumption, according to the nation's central bank. The country's economy has largely overcome the impact of high personal debt, which was a result of a period of excessive credit card spending. Although Visa usage initially skyrocketed, it has now stabilized, with a year-on-year decline of 14.8% in spending. In a recent statement, Park Seung, the president of a southern bank, noted that the economy is now trending upwards rather than downwards, suggesting that the worst of the recession is behind them. The bank has responded by setting interest rates at an all-time low of 3.25%, a move that was made in an effort to stimulate the sector. However, the bank's ability to cut interest rates further has been hindered by rising inflation, which exceeded 0.7% month-on-month in March. Despite this, the central bank is predicting economic growth of 4% this year, following a growth rate of 4.7% in 2004. Other indicators also suggest that the region is moving towards fiscal health. While exports experienced a decline in January, the lowest in 17 years, international demand is helping to fill the gap. Consumer confidence has also rebounded from a four-year low in March, with retail revenues increasing by 2.1% in February. Furthermore, the rate of credit card debt default has decreased, with only two in 13 cards now in default, down from two in five at the end of 2003. The administration has also taken steps to address the issue of credit lending, loosening regulations in an effort to control the card glut.

[{"role": "user", "content": " We present a method for image segmentation that relies on sparse correspondences between keypoints in both testing and training images. Keypoints represent automatically identified unique locations within the images, with each correspondence signifying a transition between different images. These correspondences are utilized to transfer label maps of complete organs from the training images to the test images. The keypoint transfer process consists of four stages: (i) matching keypoints, (ii) labeling keypoints based on voting, and (iii) probabilistic transfer of organ segmentations based on keypoints. We share segmentation results for abdominal tissues in whole-body CT and MRI, as well as in contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. Our method achieves a speed increase of approximately two orders of magnitude compared to traditional multi-atlas segmentation, while still delivering competitive accuracy.

[{"role": "user", "content": " A system designed to simplify the creation of website addresses using alphabets such as Cyrillic could potentially provide a backdoor for scammers, a trade organization has cautioned. The Internationalized Domain Names system has been under development for years and has recently received approval from the Internet Engineering Task Force. However, the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is worried that this system will enable scammers to more easily create fraudulent sites. The issue stems from the computer codes used to represent different languages. \n\nRegistering names that resemble those of legitimate companies can lead users to counterfeit sites aimed at stealing passwords and credit card information, which could become significantly easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. Domain names serve as the \"real language\" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which consists of a series of numbers. They are utilized so that individuals can navigate the web more effortlessly. ASCII codes are employed to represent European languages, while other languages use a hybrid system known as Unicode. For instance, the website PayPal could now be encoded using a combination of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain displayed to users would appear identical to the actual site, as a Russian 'a' looks just like an English 'a.' However, the computer code would differ, and the site it leads users to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A counterfeit PayPal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate surrounding the Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) system, according to Mr. Dyer. While the intention was to illustrate a point rather than to be malicious, the fake domain has now been returned to PayPal, but it sets a troubling precedent, Mr. Dyer stated. \"Although the IDN issue is well-known in technical circles, the commercial world is completely unaware of how easily their websites can be faked,\" said Mr. Dyer.\n\n\"It is crucial to alert users that there is a new and invisible, almost undetectable way of diverting them to what appears to be a perfectly genuine site,\" he added. There are solutions. For example, browsers could identify domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colors as a warning to users. Mr. Dyer acknowledged that it would be a massive undertaking to update all the world\u2019s browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers, could be a case of \"throwing out the baby with the bathwater,\" he said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees. \"A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs\u2014a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world,\" the organization stated in a release."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nA\u200b

FERC officials stated that the new assessment would enhance a system that previously allowed a crisis to occur in the California market last winter, when wholesale power prices surged to unprecedented levels due to limited supplies. FERC officials agreed to create a new market power assessment based on supply margin evaluations, which considers a company's role in meeting peak electricity demands. \"If you're large enough to influence the market at the time we assess it, you'll face mitigation measures,\" stated FERC Chairman Pat Wood.  \nAnalysis: Numerous stakeholders in the wholesale energy sector are still grappling with FERC's recent decision, which may have gone unnoticed by some due to its timing just before the extended holiday weekend. This ruling is monumental for FERC and carries significant implications for companies that increasingly derive a substantial portion of their profits from wholesale transactions. Additionally, state regulators have begun to evaluate the ruling's effects on retail rates, which some utilities may attempt to raise to offset declining profits in their wholesale activities. While FERC has framed this ruling as a means to address national issues similar to those experienced in the California market, the new restrictions on wholesale transactions can also be interpreted as another instance of the \"big stick\" approach the commission is employing to compel utilities to engage with regional transmission organizations (RTO).

FERC commissioners said the new test would impro=\nve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market =\nlast winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight =\nsupplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base=\nd on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in se=\nrving peak electricity loads. \"If you're big enough to control the market a=\nt the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you,\" said FERC Cha=\nirman Pat Wood.=20\nAnalysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry =\nare still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some =\nradar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday =\nweekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tre=\nmendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share =\nof their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state reg=\nulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates,=\n which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin=\nking profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this r=\nuling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience=\nd in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can al=\nso be seen as another example of the \"big stick\" that the commission is usi=\nng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat=\nions (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma=\nn Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m=\narkets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represe=\nnts a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom=\npt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading.=20\nPut into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg=\ne unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. I=\nnstead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of=\n an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committ=\ned in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. =\nColumbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Sou=\nthern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) ha=\nve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply=\ning its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a=\n former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having =\nto submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s=\neparate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined t=\nhat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the=\n areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power \"test,\" a gener=\nator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici=\nty is \"pivotal\" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a p=\nrice above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also =\nbe considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a d=\nramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's ma=\nin criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power ne=\neded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l=\nevel.=20\nThere are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not elim=\ninated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where t=\nhe grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is signific=\nant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there ar=\ne secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current rulin=\ng only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities=\n are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies=\n may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im=\npacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will=\n have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC =\nhas retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term co=\nntracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already =\nis under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not inclu=\nded in the new ruling.=20\nThe three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposal=\ns to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for=\n all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities =\nwill have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS=\n) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour =\nin a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charg=\ne for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between=\n their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region=\n that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered =\nby an independent third party.=20\nThe new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique kno=\nwn as \"split the savings.\" The methodology for this standard can get rather=\n complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies i=\ndentified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot po=\nwer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers wh=\no want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci=\nng or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions w=\nill be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decr=\nemental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at=\n $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transact=\nion price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, se=\nllers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da=\ny and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potent=\nially creates is an \"information advantage\" for buyers who have six hours t=\no evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of t=\nhe drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price=\n information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th=\ne purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original in=\ncremental bid and competing around the seller's price.=20\nNote also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad=\n investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new =\nmarket-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means i=\ns that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, =\nit is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b=\nelieves to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are =\nawaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th=\ney exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power=\n providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within =\n60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the c=\nommission determines that market manipulation has occurred.=20\nI made a previous reference to the \"big stick\" that FERC is carrying relate=\nd to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood h=\nad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of=\n charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli=\ncations, advantages that the chairman equated with the \"new world\" of the d=\neregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Compan=\ny, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be s=\nubsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi=\nbited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding n=\national RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti=\nlities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Souther=\nn Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an=\nd previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov=\ner the next five years.=20\nInterestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss=\nenting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been=\n pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu=\nate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contest=\ned, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to =\nhave been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued st=\natements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t=\nhe ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for pos=\nsible litigation.=20\nMoreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a han=\ndful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illus=\ntrates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that =\nwas for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed =\nhis post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the=\n spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this co=\nuld be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to o=\nther wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time=\n. Third, the \"split the savings\" cost-based formula could become fraught wi=\nth its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the =\npotential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov=\ner power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in t=\nhe bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruli=\nng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission =\nhas approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact=\ns AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deem=\ned by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a=\nlso not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three compani=\nes are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked tha=\nt the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi=\nll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain =\nareas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s=\nubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power=\n market are conducted.=20\nAn archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at\nwww.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20\n _____ =20\nWe encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.

This needs to be done monthly prior to flash, which will prevent any OA variances. The index for the gas value is available shortly after the 1st of the month, and since the volume is firm, there shouldn't be a problem calculating the value.

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nWe present a novel, smooth estimator for the ROC curve, which relies on log-concave density estimates of the underlying distributions. Our analysis demonstrates that this estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the empirical ROC curve when the constituent densities are indeed log-concave. Furthermore, we empirically verify that our proposed estimator outperforms the standard empirical estimate in terms of efficiency for finite sample sizes across various scenarios. Moreover, it is only marginally less efficient, if at all, compared to the fully parametric binormal estimate when the underlying distributions are normal. Notably, our estimator exhibits robustness against modest deviations from the log-concavity assumption.

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nThe Liberal Democrats may not be aware of how to effectively describe their position in British politics - the real opposition, the valid opposition, the effective opposition, or the authentic opposition. \n\nHowever, the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour. As Tory leader Michael Howard kicked off his election campaign, the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy dismissed the Conservatives as a \"fading\" force. And he insisted there was \"no limit\" to his party's ambitions in the coming poll. And he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things. Sensitive third-party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test.\n\nAnd Mr Kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party's Westminster HQ. He would make no predictions other than that he expected the Liberal Democrats to increase both their votes and their Commons seats at the election. The gap between Labour and the Tories was now so narrow - as proved, he claimed, by the defeat of Labour's Robert Jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative. On the war in Iraq, identity cards, student fees, and the council tax, there was nothing to choose between the two big parties, whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensitive, and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime, and asylum that would underpin his claim that his party was the only one worth the name.\n\nThere was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. That is no longer the case with the Liberal Democrats. The other parties will still insist that the Liberal Democrats are hopeless whose greatest effect on the poll will be to deny them otherwise winnable seats. Labour, in particular, fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the Liberal Democrats, allowing the Tories to win some seats. But Mr Kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that. He will not talk about a big breakthrough, although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. They would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may have genuinely replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power. The Liberal Democrats will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stance against the war in Iraq. But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensitive, costed, and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime, and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party is the only one worth the name."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nT\u200bh\u200be\u200by\u200b \u200bm\u200ba\u200by\u200b \u200bn\u200bo\u200bt\u200b \u200bk\u200bn\u200bo\u200bw\u200b

Of course, her Draenic mind went to much darker, kinkier places, which of course she didn't mind at all. She could certainly work with that as well. She looked down at her new pet, noting how longingly and dreamily she looked into her owner's eyes. She sighed and couldn't help but love that innocent gaze and she gently stroked her hair, \"Mistress would work quite fine, my puppy. Anything like that would be fine, yes.\""}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " Medical image segmentation is a crucial prerequisite for the advancement of healthcare systems, particularly in the areas of disease diagnosis and treatment planning. In various medical image segmentation tasks, the U-shaped architecture, commonly referred to as U-Net, has emerged as the de facto standard and has achieved remarkable success. However, due to the inherent locality of convolution operations, U-Net typically exhibits limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers, designed for sequence-to-sequence prediction, have surfaced as alternative architectures with built-in global self-attention mechanisms, but they may lead to restricted localization capabilities because of inadequate low-level details. In this paper, we introduce TransUNet, which combines the strengths of both Transformers and U-Net, presenting a robust alternative for medical image segmentation. On one side, the Transformer encodes tokenized image patches from a convolutional neural network (CNN) feature map as the input sequence for extracting global contexts. On the other side, the decoder upsamples the encoded features, which are then integrated with the high-resolution CNN feature maps to facilitate precise localization.

We are optimistic that his political influence will improve the likelihood of it being published.  \nAugust 9, 2000  \nWall Street Journal  \n200 Liberty Street  \nNew York, NY 10281  \nDear Editor:  \nKudos to John Fialka and Rebecca Smith for their groundbreaking article that attempts to clarify the underlying issues contributing to the energy crisis in the overheated West (Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms, August 4). This article highlights that the ongoing capacity and delivery crises in electricity across the nation are likely to persist for a straightforward reason: electricity is a new industry still operating under outdated regulations. While it is evolving into a competitive market, the antiquated rules designed for a government-sanctioned monopoly have not been revised.  \nConsequently, some traditional utilities are taking advantage of and even exacerbating the crises through actions that are not governed by the old regulations. As detailed in the article, utilities can inflate prices, worsen the energy deficit by withholding electricity from the grid, or obstruct the free flow of electricity across the lines they manage. This is strategic maneuvering that is highly profitable and legal, yet certainly not in the public's best interest.  \nThe solution to this issue is quite straightforward. New regulations need to be established. Certain outdated laws should be repealed. Additionally, the Federal government must be granted some oversight over this interstate commodity to ensure that the general welfare can exert control over local profiteering. There are legislative proposals in Congress aimed at implementing these changes. However, a few influential utilities are hindering their progress. As long as this obstruction persists, the industry will be unable to advance towards modernization, expand generating capacity, and optimize the transmission of electricity between regions. Eventually, Congress will enact the necessary legislation. Why not do it now?  \nSincerely,  \nBill Paxon  \nNational Chairman  \nAmericans for Affordable Electricity  "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDate: Wed, 9 Aug 2000 04:06:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: cynthia.sandherr@enron.com\nTo: mark.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: RE: letter to editor of Wall Street Journal\nBody: \nCc: steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, joe.hillings@enron.com, \n\ttom.briggs@enron.com, chris.long@enron.com, stephen.burns@enron.com, \n\tallison.navin@enron.com, ed@buckham.com, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com, \n\tcingebretson@bracepatt.com, joe.hartsoe@enron.com\nBcc: steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, joe.hillings@enron.com, \n\ttom.briggs@enron.com, chris.long@enron.com, stephen.burns@enron.com, \n\tallison.navin@enron.com, ed@buckham.com, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com, \n\tcingebretson@bracepatt.com, joe.hartsoe@enron.com\nMark: Just wanted you to be aware per our request, Bill Paxon sent the \nattached Letter to the Editor of the Wall Street Journal on behalf of AAE. \nWe hope his political standing will enhance the chances for the paper to \nprint it.\nAugust 9, 2000\nWall Street Journal\n200 Liberty Street\nNew York, NY 10281\nDear Editor:\nJohn Fialka and Rebecca Smith are to be congratulated for the first piece of\njournalism I am aware of that has attempted to explain what is really behind\nthe energy problems in the overheated West (Deregulation Leaves Electricity\nMarket Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms, August 4). As this piece makes\nclear, these crises of capacity and delivery of electricity around the\nnation are doomed to continue for a simple reason: electricity is a new\ngame, still being played under old rules. It is becoming a competitive\nmarket, but the old rules written for a government-sanctioned monopoly market \nhaven't been\nupdated.\nAs a result, some old-line utilities are exploiting and even contributing to\nthe crises with behavior that is not controlled by the old rules. As the\nstory details, utilities can drive prices up, exacerbate the energy shortage\nby withholding electricity from the grid, or impede the free flow of\nelectricity across lines they control. It's gamesmanship, very profitable\nand not illegal, but definitely not in the public interest.\nThere is a very simple fix to the problem. Write new rules. Some old\nlaws need to be repealed. Some new oversight over this interstate commodity\nhas to be given the Federal government so that the general welfare gains\nsome control over local profiteering. There are bills in Congress that make\nthese fixes. But a few powerful utilities block their passage. As long as\nthis blockade remains in effect, the industry cannot move forward to\nmodernize itself, build new generating capacity, and streamline the way\nelectricity moves from region to region. Some day, Congress will pass the\nneeded legislation. Why not now?\nSincerely,\nBill Paxon\nNational Chairman\nAmericans for Affordable Electricity"}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " Compared to the general semantic segmentation challenge, portrait segmentation demands a higher level of precision regarding boundary areas. However, this issue has not been thoroughly explored in earlier studies. In this paper, we introduce a boundary-sensitive deep neural network (BSN) specifically for portrait segmentation. BSN incorporates three innovative techniques. First, we propose an individual boundary-sensitive kernel by dilating the contour line and assigning boundary pixels with multi-class labels. Second, a global boundary-sensitive kernel is utilized as a position-sensitive prior to further constrain the overall shape of the segmentation map. Third, we jointly train a boundary-sensitive attribute classifier alongside the segmentation network to enhance the network with semantic boundary shape information. We have assessed BSN on the largest public portrait segmentation dataset to date, namely the PFSCN dataset, as well as on portrait images gathered from three other popular image segmentation datasets: COCO, COCO-Stuff, and PASCAL VOC. Our approach demonstrates superior quantitative and qualitative performance across all datasets, particularly in the boundary areas."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n\u0421\u043em\u0440\u0430r\u0435d t\u043e th\u0435 g\u0435n\u0435r\u0430l s\u0435m\u0430nt\u0456\u0441 s\u0435gm\u0435nt\u0430t\u0456\u043en \u0440r\u043ebl\u0435m, \u0440\u043ertr\u0430\u0456t s\u0435gm\u0435nt\u0430t\u0456\u043en\nh\u0430s h\u0456gh\u0435r \u0440r\u0435\u0441\u0456s\u0456\u043en r\u0435qu\u0456r\u0435m\u0435nt \u043en b\u043eund\u0430r\u0443 \u0430r\u0435\u0430. \u041d\u043ew\u0435v\u0435r, th\u0456s \u0440r\u043ebl\u0435m h\u0430s\nn\u043et b\u0435\u0435n w\u0435ll stud\u0456\u0435d \u0456n \u0440r\u0435v\u0456\u043eus w\u043erks. \u0406n th\u0456s \u0440\u0430\u0440\u0435r, w\u0435 \u0440r\u043e\u0440\u043es\u0435 \u0430\nb\u043eund\u0430r\u0443-s\u0435ns\u0456t\u0456v\u0435 d\u0435\u0435\u0440 n\u0435ur\u0430l n\u0435tw\u043erk (\u0412S\u039d) f\u043er \u0440\u043ertr\u0430\u0456t s\u0435gm\u0435nt\u0430t\u0456\u043en. \u0392S\u039d\n\u0456ntr\u043edu\u0441\u0435s thr\u0435\u0435 n\u043ev\u0435l t\u0435\u0441hn\u0456qu\u0435s.

Argentina, who played impressively, seemed to have the match under control until the final moments. The Pumas stunned the Irish early with a try from Federico Aramburu, while Felipe Contepomi contributed 14 points. The well-organized and sharper Pumas outperformed Ireland in the initial phases. Indiscipline allowed Argentina's Leinster fly-half Contepomi to score the first points with a simple penalty in the third minute. He struck again two minutes later, catching a disorganized Ireland off guard with the game's first try. After Ireland lost possession, Manuel Contepomi broke through a disjointed defense and passed to his midfield partner Aramburu, who dashed in for a try under the posts. O'Gara finally got Ireland on the scoreboard with a drop goal in the ninth minute, but Contepomi quickly responded with his second penalty two minutes later. Battling against a strong wind and rain, Ireland struggled in tight situations, leading to numerous turnovers against a tough defense. O'Gara managed to convert his second penalty in the 36th minute, but once again, Contepomi answered back with a penalty four minutes into first-half injury time. The second half began similarly to the first, with O'Gara scoring another penalty in the 45th minute, only for Contepomi to equalize three minutes later. The Pumas' upper-body strength prevented Ireland from gaining control up front, and the three-quarters found little room to operate. Ireland had to depend on O'Gara's kicking to stay competitive rather than executing any planned running plays. The Munsterman added two more penalties\u2014one from 48 meters\u2014bringing his team within four points with 13 minutes left. Ireland's opportunity arose when Argentina's number eight Gonzalo Longo received a yellow card for a line-out infringement with six minutes remaining. O'Gara capitalized on this chance, successfully converting his fifth penalty to set up a tense finish. However, Ireland displayed remarkable composure, positioning themselves for O'Gara to launch a massive drop goal, completing a remarkable, albeit fortunate, comeback."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nAn injury-time dropped goal by Ronan O'Gara stole victory for Ireland from underneath the noses of Argentina at Lansdowne Road on Saturday.\nO'Gara kicked all of Ireland's points, with two dropped goals and five penalties, to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. An impressive Argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. The Pumas shocked the Irish early on with a try from Federico Aramburu, and Felipe Contepomi kicked 14 points. The well-drilled and sharper Pumas out-played and out-thought Ireland in the early stages. Indiscipline allowed Argentina's Leinster fly-half Contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. He was on the mark again two minutes later when Argentina shocked a ragged Ireland with the first try of the game. Ireland turned the ball over and Manuel Contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner Aramburu to sprint in under the posts. O'Gara finally got Ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for Contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. Playing into a strong wind and rain, Ireland continued to come second best in tight situations, and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. O'Gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute, but once again Contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. The second-half started as the first had ended. O'Gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute, but Contepomi matched it three minutes later. The upper-body strength of the Pumas never allowed Ireland to take control up front, while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. Ireland had to rely on O'Gara's boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. The Munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. And Ireland's chance came when Argentina's number eight Gonzalo Longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. O'Gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. But Ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow O'Gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous, if fortuitous, comeback."}]

She shares a personal experience where she met a \"new best friend\" who seemed to understand her perfectly. However, as she reached out to hug this friend, she realized that it was actually her own reflection in the mirror.\n\nRegina's poem conveys a valuable lesson: true friends can be hard to find, but the most important one is often the one we overlook \u2013 ourselves. She encourages us to appreciate the value of self-reflection and to pass on this message to our friends.\n\n[Image]\n\nTrue friends are indeed rare, but by embracing our own company, we can cultivate a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.\n\n[Image]\n\nBrought to you by [Image] [Image]\n\n[End of text]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDate: Fri, 25 Aug 2000 00:52:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: judy.hernandez@enron.com\nTo: jcutaia@tupac.com, suhernan@llgm.com, dora_thurmond@uniteddc.com, \n\tsthompson47@hotmail.com, priscillagilbert@juno.com, \n\tsandra.mcnichols@enron.com, leslie.smith@enron.com, \n\tamber.ebow@enron.com, melissa.rodriguez@enron.com, \n\tmaria.sandoval@enron.com\nSubject: [Fwd: My New Best Friend]\nBody: \n---------------------- Forwarded by Judy Hernandez/HOU/ECT on 08/25/2000 \n07:47 AM ---------------------------\nRegina Blackshear@ENRON\n08/24/2000 07:25 PM\nTo: Diane Salcido/Corp/Enron@Enron, Angela Barnett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eve \nPuckett/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Amber Limas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Judy \nHernandez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pamela Mitchell/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: \nSubject: [Fwd: My New Best Friend]\nThis is a very good person to know.\n[IMAGE]\nToday I met a great new friend\nWho knew me right away \nIt was funny how she understood \nAll I had to say \nShe listened to my problems\nShe listened to my dreams \nWe talked about love and life \nShe'd been there, too, it seems \n I never once felt judged by her\nShe knew just how I felt \nShe seemed to just accept me \nAnd all the problems I'd been dealt \nShe didn't interrupt me\nOr need to have her say \nShe just listened very patiently \nAnd didn't go away \nI wanted her to understand\nHow much this meant to me \nBut as I went to hug her \nSomething startled me \nI put my arms in front of me\nAnd went to pull her nearer \nAnd realized that my new best friend \nWas nothing but a mirror. \n[IMAGE]\n?\nTrue Friends are hard to come by.

This particular chain letter aims to bring relief to men who are tired and unhappy. Unlike most chain letters, it doesn't require any payment.\n\nTo participate, simply forward this letter to five of your friends who are equally dissatisfied with their lives. Then, send your wife or girlfriend to the person whose name is at the top of the list, and add your name to the bottom. When it's your turn, you'll receive 15,625 women. It's likely that one of them will be an improvement over your current partner. I know someone who has already received 184 women, and four of them were worth keeping.\n\nRemember, this chain is said to bring good luck. One man's pit bull died, and the next day he received a Playboy model. Another man was able to choose between a Hooters waitress and a Hollywood supermodel. You can be lucky too, but be warned: breaking the chain will only result in getting your current partner back.\n\nDo not break the chain."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDate: Tue, 18 Apr 2000 07:50:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: gerald.nemec@enron.com\nTo: eric.gillaspie@enron.com, ryan.f.ruppert@exxon.sprint.com\nSubject: FW: The ultimate chain letter !!!!\nBody: \n---------------------- Forwarded by Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT on 04/18/2000 02:42 \nPM ---------------------------\nBrian Hendon@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS\n04/18/2000 02:32 PM\nTo: Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT@ECT, Catherine Pernot/Enron Communications@Enron \nCommunications\ncc: \nSubject: FW: The ultimate chain letter !!!!\n>\n> Gentlemen:\n> Normally I am against chain letters but this is in a good cause.....\n>\n> This chain letter was started in hopes of bringing relief to tired and\n> discouraged men.

[{"role": "user", "content": " This abstract provides a concise overview of a segmentation algorithm created for the ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Detection Competition held at [ref]. The aim of the competition is to achieve a segmentation (in the form of a binary mask image) of skin lesions in dermoscopic images that closely resembles the segmentation performed by trained clinicians, which serves as the ground truth. This project focuses solely on the segmentation phase of the challenge, excluding the other phases (feature extraction and lesion identification).\n\nThe proposed algorithm is comprised of four steps: (1) preprocessing of the lesion image, (2) segmentation of the image through k-means clustering based on pixel colors, (3) computation of a set of features that describe the characteristics of each segmented area, and (4) determination of a final score for each area, indicating the likelihood of it representing an appropriate lesion segmentation. The scores in step (4) are derived by averaging the outputs of two distinct regression models, using the scores of each area as input. Prior to applying the algorithm, these regression models must be trained with the training set of images and ground truth masks provided by the competition. Steps 2 to 4 are iterated with an increasing number of clusters (resulting in the image being segmented into more areas) until no further enhancement in the calculated scores is observed."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nThis abstract briefly describes a segmentation algorithm developed for the\nISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Detection Competition hosted at [ref].

[{"role": "user", "content": " Two individuals involved in a vast network of internet software pirates, referred to as Drink Or Die, have been convicted at the Old Bailey. BBC News investigates the operations of this network and the motivations of its participants. They identified themselves as Drink Or Die (DOD). This group consisted of computer enthusiasts who found enjoyment in cracking codes that protected copyrighted software like Windows 95. They would subsequently share their findings with one another. There is no indication that any of them gained financial profit. However, authorities in both Britain and the United States viewed it as software piracy and held a negative perspective on networks like DOD, which was one of several so-called warez organizations active on the internet. In October 2000, the US Customs Service initiated an investigation into DOD and other networks, including Razor 1911, Risciso, Myth, and Popz. \n\nFourteen months later, US Customs coordinated a series of raids worldwide as part of Operation Buccaneer. Seventy search warrants were executed in the US, Britain, Australia, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. At least 60 individuals were arrested globally, with 45 of them in the US. Among the leaders of the network were Americans John Sankus\u2014known by his internet alias Eriflleh (Hellfire spelled backward)\u2014Richard Berry, Kent Kartadinata, and Christopher Tresco, who operated a server located at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \n\nThe longest prison sentence\u201446 months\u2014was given to Sankus, a 28-year-old from Philadelphia. US Attorney Paul McNulty stated at the time: \"John Sankus and his tech-gang operated in the faceless world of the internet and thought they would never be caught. They were mistaken. These sentences, along with those to follow, should send a message to others harboring similar beliefs of invincibility.\" However, one man still in legal limbo is British-born Australian Hew Raymond Griffiths, who is continuing to contest extradition to the US. \n\nUS Customs claimed Mr. Griffiths was one of DOD's leaders, but his lawyer, Antony Townsend, told the BBC News website that this was a laughable assertion, adding: \"He was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he couldn't even download software. The allegation that he was the group's co-leader is illusory. He had the least technical skills of anyone, couldn't crack any codes, and has only been labeled a leader because he was a loudmouth who wrote a lot on their message board.\" Mr. Townsend stated that if he had committed any crimes, he should be prosecuted in Australia, not the US. He claimed that the Australian government's decision to accept the extradition request was typical of their current \"acquiescent\" attitude toward the US. \n\nMr. Griffiths is expecting to hear this week the outcome of his appeal against the decision to extradite him. Those involved would adopt internet aliases that functioned similarly to tags used by graffiti artists. They could then boast about their code-cracking skills without revealing their true identities. Alex Bell, whose trial at the Old Bailey concluded on Friday, was known as Mr. 2940\u2014after a computer device\u2014while his co-defendant Steven Dowd's nickname, curiously, was Tim. \n\nA spokesman for US Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement, Dean Boyd, stated that DOD did not seem to be motivated by money. Their motivation was the recognition that came with being able to crack sophisticated software. He told the BBC News website: \"Primarily, they were just interested in how fast they could crack the code. It was all about underground notoriety.\" However, Mr. Boyd pointed out that once the software was distributed on the internet, it fell into the hands of organized criminals who could mass-produce pirated software at no cost. \"It cost US industries a lot of money, billions of dollars,\" he said. Mr. Boyd added: \"It was truly global in scope. We raided a number of universities, including Duke (in North Carolina) and MIT, and found that several of the people involved were employed by major computer corporations. They would go home from work in the evenings and get involved in this warez culture.\" Warez groups, which began to emerge in the early 1990s, operated according to a strict code of honor. \n\nFor instance, if one group cracked the software first, its rivals would respect that achievement and not seek to claim it for themselves. Mr. Boyd stated that the dismantling of DOD was a significant coup, but he added: \"I'm not going to sit here and say we have solved the problem. There are still hackers and people who do this for fun. Internet piracy of computer software remains a gigantic problem.\" A spokesman for the Business Software Alliance stated: \"DOD members claim they did not profit at all. But they did profit by gaining access to very expensive servers.\" He said DOD and other warez groups were fostering a \"culture of piracy\" on the"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n\u0422w\u043e m\u0435n wh\u043e w\u0435r\u0435 \u0440\u0430rt \u043ef \u0430 hug\u0435 n\u0435tw\u043erk \u043ef \u0456nt\u0435rn\u0435t s\u043eftw\u0430r\u0435 \u0440\u0456r\u0430t\u0435s, kn\u043ewn \u0430s Dr\u0456nk \u041er D\u0456\u0435, h\u0430v\u0435 b\u0435\u0435n \u0441\u043env\u0456\u0441t\u0435d \u0430t th\u0435 \u039fld \u0392\u0430\u0456l\u0435\u0443. \u0392\u0412\u0421 \u039d\u0435ws \u0456nv\u0435st\u0456g\u0430t\u0435s h\u043ew th\u0435 n\u0435tw\u043erk w\u043erk\u0435d \u0430nd wh\u0430t m\u043et\u0456v\u0430t\u0435d th\u043es\u0435 \u0456nv\u043elv\u0435d.\n\u03a4h\u0435\u0443 \u0441\u0430ll\u0435d th\u0435ms\u0435lv\u0435s Dr\u0456nk \u041er D\u0456\u0435 (D\u041eD). \u03a4h\u0435\u0443 w\u0435r\u0435 \u0430 n\u0435tw\u043erk \u043ef \u0441\u043em\u0440ut\u0435r buffs wh\u043e d\u0435r\u0456v\u0435d \u0440l\u0435\u0430sur\u0435 fr\u043em \u0441r\u0430\u0441k\u0456ng \u0441\u043ed\u0435s \u0440r\u043et\u0435\u0441t\u0456ng \u0441\u043e\u0440\u0443r\u0456ght\u0435d s\u043eftw\u0430r\u0435 su\u0441h \u0430s W\u0456nd\u043ews 95. \u0422h\u0435\u0443 w\u043euld th\u0435n sh\u0430r\u0435 \u0456t w\u0456th \u0435\u0430\u0441h \u043eth\u0435r. \u03a4h\u0435r\u0435 \u0456s n\u043e sugg\u0435st\u0456\u043en \u0430n\u0443 \u043ef th\u0435m \u0440r\u043ef\u0456t\u0435d f\u0456n\u0430n\u0441\u0456\u0430ll\u0443. \u0392ut th\u0435 \u0430uth\u043er\u0456t\u0456\u0435s \u0456n b\u043eth \u0412r\u0456t\u0430\u0456n \u0430nd th\u0435 Un\u0456t\u0435d St\u0430t\u0435s \u0441\u043ens\u0456d\u0435r\u0435d \u0456t s\u043eftw\u0430r\u0435 \u0440\u0456r\u0430\u0441\u0443 \u0430nd t\u043e\u043ek \u0430 d\u0456m v\u0456\u0435w \u043ef n\u0435tw\u043erks su\u0441h \u0430s D\u041eD, \u043en\u0435 \u043ef \u0430 numb\u0435r \u043ef s\u043e-\u0441\u0430ll\u0435d w\u0430r\u0435z \u043erg\u0430n\u0456s\u0430t\u0456\u043ens \u043e\u0440\u0435r\u0430t\u0456ng \u043en th\u0435 \u0456nt\u0435rn\u0435t. \u0406n \u041e\u0441t\u043eb\u0435r 2000 th\u0435 US \u0421ust\u043ems S\u0435rv\u0456\u0441\u0435 b\u0435g\u0430n \u0430n \u0456nv\u0435st\u0456g\u0430t\u0456\u043en \u0456nt\u043e D\u041eD \u0430nd \u043eth\u0435r n\u0435tw\u043erks, su\u0441h \u0430s R\u0430z\u043er 1911, R\u0456s\u0441\u0456s\u043e, \u041c\u0443th \u0430nd \u03a1\u043e\u0440z.\nF\u043eurt\u0435\u0435n m\u043enths l\u0430t\u0435r US \u0421ust\u043ems \u0441\u043e-\u043erd\u0456n\u0430t\u0435d \u0430 s\u0435r\u0456\u0435s \u043ef r\u0430\u0456ds \u0430\u0441r\u043ess th\u0435 gl\u043eb\u0435 \u0430s \u0440\u0430rt \u043ef \u041e\u0440\u0435r\u0430t\u0456\u043en \u0392u\u0441\u0441\u0430n\u0435\u0435r.

Gordon and a class of approximately 1.2 million electricity customers, including those of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E), alleges that the defendants engaged in unfair business practices, including improperly using confidential real-time data to \"game\" the market, withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchange's forward markets, and selling or parking electricity with affiliates in other states to artificially drive up prices in the California markets.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the defendants' actions resulted in record-high wholesale electricity prices, causing consumers to pay approximately $4 billion more for electricity than they otherwise would have. The lawsuit seeks treble damages, attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements, as well as injunctive and equitable relief, including the disgorgement of the defendants' unlawful profits.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that the defendants' actions violated the Cartwright Act, which prohibits trusts and conspiracies in restraint of trade, and the Unfair Trade Practices Act, which prohibits unfair competition. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act and to require them to disgorge all monies obtained by virtue of their violations.\n\nThe lawsuit further alleges that the defendants' actions were unconscionable, given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets for electricity, and the consumers' need for electrical power. The lawsuit seeks to restore to the consumers all money wrongfully taken from them and to allow them a claim in the full amount of all of the defendants' ill-gotten gains.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on November 27, 2000, by the law firm of Krause & Kalfayan, and was forwarded to Mark Palmer at Enron by Jason Leopold on November 29, 2000."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDate: Wed, 29 Nov 2000 02:56:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: mark.palmer@enron.com\nTo: richard.shapiro@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com, \n\trichard.sanders@enron.com, paul.kaufman@enron.com\nSubject: RE: FW: ANNOUNCEMENT: Notice of Press Conference today\nBody: \nHere's the suit filed against the generators.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21\n Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the\ninvestigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:\n I.\n NATURE OF THE CASE\n1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California\nfor defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity. During the\nspring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,\nincluding defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the\nCalifornia wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated\nwholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western\nUnited States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,\nimproperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and\nmaintenance data, and transmission system flow data to \"game\" the wholesale\nelectricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the\nCalifornia Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power\nwith affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at\ninflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide\nwith other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling\ntransmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.\n2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of\nthe California Tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesale\nelectricity within California.\n3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have\ndirectly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the\nCalifornia Power Exchange. As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union\nTribune: \"The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are\nexorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19\ncents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of\nconfiscatory rates.\"\n 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (\"FERC\") expressly found that electricity prices in California\nhave been maintained at \"unjust and unreasonable\" levels during the relevant\nperiod, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate\nrefunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto. In its November\n22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public\nUtilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by\nwholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied\nthrough the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4\nbillion dollars during the summer of 2000. In its November 22nd response to\nthe November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator\n(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known\nas the \"power grid\", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the\nexercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.\n II.\n VENUE\n5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the\nState of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful\nmanipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego\nCounty.\nIII.\n PARTIES\n6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,\nCalifornia. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of\nSDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class\nPeriod (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been\nartificially inflated by defendants' misconduct. Moreover, plaintiff Pamela\nR. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack\nof circulation. Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela\nR. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health\nconsequences. As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must\nmaintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and\n71 degrees during the day. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to\nterminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and\nunfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'\nmisconduct. Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or\npaid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:\n/ / /\n/ / /\n/ / /\n/ / /\nDates\nTotal Electric Charges\n5-26 to 6-27-00\n$180.92\n6-27 to 7-27-00\n$226.67\n7-28 to 8-28-00\n$311.84\n8-28 to 9-27-00\n$143.48\n9-27 to 10-26-00\n$84.71\n7. Plaintiff was charged less for electricity per kWh prior to the\nClass Period and the inception of Defendants' wrongful conduct:\nDates\nTotal Electric Charges\n3-29 to 4-27-00\n$100.50\n8. Defendant Reliant Energy (hereinafter \"Reliant\") is a Houston, Texas\nbased public corporation doing business in the state of California as\nReliant Energy Services. It is a generator and trader of wholesale\nelectricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including\nplaintiff and the class, and is a WSCC member. Reliant operates five\nelectricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale\nelectricity to the California Power Exchange.\n9. Defendant Southern Company (hereinafter \"Southern\") is an Atlanta,\nGeorgia based public corporation doing business in the state of California\nas Southern Energy, Inc. It is a generator and trader of wholesale\nelectricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including\nplaintiff and the class, and is a WSCC member. Southern Energy operates six\nelectricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale\nelectricity to the California Power Exchange.\n10. Defendant Dynegy, Inc. (hereinafter \"Dynegy\") is a Houston, Texas\nbased public corporation doing business in the state of California as Dynegy\nMarketing and Trade. It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity\nwhich is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and\nthe class, and is a WSCC member. Dynegy operates two electricity generating\npower plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the\nCalifornia Power Exchange.\n 11. Defendant NRG Energy, Inc. (hereinafter \"NRG\") is a Minneapolis,\nMinnesota based public corporation doing business in the state of California\nas NRG, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately\nsold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class. In\npartnership with defendant Dynegy, NRG operates eight electricity generating\nplants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California\nPower Exchange.\n12. Defendant AES Corporation (hereinafter \"AES\") is an Arlington,\nVirginia based public corporation doing business in the state of California\nas AES Pacific Group, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which\nis ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the\nclass, and a WSCC member. AES Pacific Group operates four electricity\ngenerating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity\nto the California Power Exchange.\n13. Defendant Williams Energy is a Tulsa, Oklahoma based public\ncorporation doing business in the state of California as Williams Energy\nMarketing and Trading Company, a generator and trader of wholesale\nelectricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including\nplaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Williams Energy Marketing and\nTrading Company operates three electricity generating plants in southern\nCalifornia which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power\nExchange.\n14. Defendant Duke Energy North America (hereinafter \"Duke Energy\") is a\nHouston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of\nCalifornia as Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC, a generator and trader\nof wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers,\nincluding plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Duke Energy operates\nfour electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale\nelectricity to the California Power Exchange.\n 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under\nfictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.\nWhen their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend\nthis complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.\nPlaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of\nthe fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the\noccurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and\ndamages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged. Further, Plaintiff is informed and\nbelieves, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the\nDefendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited\nfrom the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,\nand that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused\ninjury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.\n IV.\n CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of\nCivil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,\nincluding the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),\nwho purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange\nduring the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial\n(hereinafter the \"Class Period\"). All such persons and entities have paid\nand/or have been charged prices for electricity that were \"unjust and\nunreasonable\" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'\nexercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,\nmanipulations, and unlawful actions. Members of the Class are extremely\nnumerous and their joinder would be impracticable. Approximately 1.2\nmillion SDG&E customers are within the class.\n17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,\nincluding:\n-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing\nconfidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter\n\"gamed\" the market;\n-whether defendants charged \"unjust and unreasonable\" prices for electricity\nduring the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for\nelectricity;\n-whether defendants exercised \"market power\" in the California electricity\nmarket during the Class Period;\n-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be\nrefunded and paid to members of the Class.\n18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the\ninterests of the class.\n19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action\nand consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this\naction.\n20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and\nefficient adjudication of this controversy. The size of the individual\ndamages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the\ndefendants' operations and alleged misconduct. A class action is the only\nmethod whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and\nobtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate\nany difficulty with the management of this action.\n/ / /\n V.\n COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT\nA. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets\n21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required\nthe State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their\ngenerating plants. The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition\ninto the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for\nelectrical power. In fact, however, certain participants in this recently\nderegulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken\nadvantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained\nconfidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for\nelectricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at\nthe expense of California consumers.\n22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to\nfacilitate the workings of this new market. California's investor owned\nutilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),\nand San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the\"Utilities\"), now purchase\nelectricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,\nincluding defendants, through a market known as the California Power\nExchange (PX). The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of\nwholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time\nmarkets. Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,\nuntil just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and\nprohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.\n23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California\nIndependent System Operator (CAISO). The CAISO is an \"independent\"\nnon-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives\nfrom among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow\nof electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage\npower lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.\nApproximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the\nCAISO managed \"power grid\". The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,\ndemand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of\npower to meet that demand.\n/ / /\n 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance\nMarket (the \"Real Time Market\"). When the CAISO receives bids from\nsuppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept\nany bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the\nsingle price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in\nthe Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which\nis the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing\nto sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This\nmechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to\ngame the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing\nprice.\n25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,\nbut merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply\nand demand. Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the\ndaily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity\nto the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to\nobtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.\n26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used\nto balance supply and demand of electricity. Sellers in the Replacement\nReserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity. If\ncalled upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve\nMarket also receive the Real Time Market price. Thus, if generators know\nthat capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the\nspot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve\nMarket. Access to real time generating information facilitates such\n\"gaming\" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing\nsupply.\n27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase\nenergy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price\ncap. The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000. California\ngenerators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in\norder to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California\nmarkets. They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and\nuncapped prices. As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,\n2000 Report (\"the PX Compliance Report\"):\n/ / /\n \"During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the\nReal-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export\nenergy out of California. Surrounding control areas can effectively park\nthat energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the\nstate.\"\nId. at p. 44.\n28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase\nin exports from the California energy market, despite the very high prices\nand short supplies that existed in the State.\n \"Market power\" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to\nsignificantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from\ncompetitive levels for a material period of time. Generators and suppliers\n(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or\neconomically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out\nof the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in\nways that impede the efficiency of the market.\n29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small\nnumber of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total\ngenerating capacity. The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise\nof market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a\ntrue scarcity of available generating capacity. In addition, the relatively\ninelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market\npower.\nB. Defendants' Improper Acts\n30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems\nCoordinating Council (\"WSCC\"), an organization consisting of electric\nindustry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as\nto electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission\nsystem flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market\nparticipants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity\nmarket participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access\nto real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such\ndata was forbidden by the ISO Tariff. When requested by various\ngovernmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission\n(\"CPUC\") the WSCC refused access.\n/ / /\n/ / /\n/ / /\n 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;\nMeter Data supplied by an ISO metered entity shall be made available by the\nISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and\nother authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall\nnot be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by\nlaw, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO\nTariff.\n32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:\nThe ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and\ninformation provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as\nconfidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,\nhowever, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is\nexplicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of\nthis ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant\nproviding the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO\nTariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall\ncomply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information\nthat becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than\nas a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).\n33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:\nThe following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators\nshall be treated by the ISO as confidential:\n(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;\n(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not\ndesignated by the scheduling coordinator as available;\n(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;\n(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;\n(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a\nchange to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short\nterm (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name\nof that Generator.\n34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:\nNo Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO\nor to review any documents, data or other information of another Market\nParticipant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be\ntreated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market\nParticipant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other\ninformation that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,\ndata, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such\nconfidential data or information relating to an individual Market\nParticipant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as\nprovided for in its bylaws.\n 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information\nProtocol (MMIP). The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the\nworkplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to\nidentify abuses of market power. The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all\nISO Market Participants, including Defendants.\n36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:\nAnomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs\nsignificantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not\nrequire continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or\nunexplained market outcomes. Evidence of such behavior may be derived from\na number of circumstances, including:\nMMIP 2.1.1.1 withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in\nwhich it would normally be offered in a competitive market;\nMMIP 2.1.1.2 unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by\nGenerators;\nMMIP 2.1.1.3 unusual trades or transactions;\nMMIP 2.1.1.4 pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with\nprevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear\nconsistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;\nand\nMMIP 2.1.1.5 unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or\nexports to other markets or exchanges.\nThe Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether\nthe continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the\npresence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the\noperation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the\nstrategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates\nthe presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable\npractices.\n37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:\n\"Gaming\", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth\nin the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission\nconstraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the\ndetriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.\n\"Gaming\" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that\nmay affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as\nloop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits\non energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may\notherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price\nmanipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.\n 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to\nshare access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that\nits publication and use violated the ISO's operating procedures, as set\nforth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,\nand by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants were\nauthorized to sell electricity to the PX. Those tariffs and protocols\nrequired that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market\nand not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive\nbehavior.\n39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October\n19, 2000, that:\n\"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from\nthe state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale\nelectricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems\nCoordinating Council.\n * * * * * * *\n\"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System\nOperator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental\n[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western\nU.S., about power plant activity in the state.\n\"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data\nvia an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200\nmegawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .\n\"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on\nthe grid . . . .\n\"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is\nbeing used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,\ndirector of dispatch with the WSCC.\n * * * * * *\n\"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and\ndrive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular\nregion and use that to gouge customers.\n\"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and\nreal-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to\nkeep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the\nWSCC.\n\"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information to the\nWSCC or other market participants.\"\n 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time\ndata to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,\nstrategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting\nelectricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price\nand other market prices. As a direct result of their improper access to and\nuse of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply\nupwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices\never since. FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now\nconcluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.\n41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:\n\"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that\nthey held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices\nskyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to\nprevent blackouts.\n\"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear\nevidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were\ncreating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.\n * * * * * *\nMcCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the\nEncina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it\ncould have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of\nproduction. The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent\nof what would be expected under traditional economic theory.\nEconomists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate\nelectricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per\nmegawatt hour.\nA separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed \"mysterious\ncutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices.\"\n * * ** *\n\"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that\nelectricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market\nthis summer before they would commit their power plants to production.\"\n\"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim\nDetmers, the ISO's operations chief.\"\n 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their\ncompetitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward\nmarkets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to\nbalance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the\nsingle price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given\nperiod. In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with\naffiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the\nCalifornia markets. They then sold that electricity back into the\nCalifornia markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.\nThese tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market\nto purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot\nMarket, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The\nSpot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the\ndemand for energy.\nC. Results of Defendants' Activities\n43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have\nraised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates\nthat would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the\ncosts of generating that electricity. Those prices have resulted in an\napproximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where\nretail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass\nthrough of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the\ndefendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.\n44. As the Market Surveillance Committee (\"MSC\") of the CAISO concluded\nin its September 6, 2000 Report (\"the MSC Report\"), during the months of May\nand June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy\nmarket were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have\nbeen generated under competitive pricing conditions. MSC Report at p. 2.\nThe MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a\n\"significant amount of market power\" in the California energy markets,\nbeginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the\nClass Period. Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.\n45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets\nduring August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,\ncompared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier. While load demand conditions in\nCalifornia during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they\nwere similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower. Peak\ndemand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two\nyears, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand\ncaused these price increases. Indeed, some California electricity producers\nwere only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.\n 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the\nnight, when electricity is abundant and demand is low. Further, prices in\nNovember 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the\nsummer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'\nlevels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive\nmarketplace.\n47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they\nartificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge\nwindfall profits. As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union\nTribune, analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity\nindustry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000\ncould reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.\nFeygin stated, \"'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability\nof last year . . .. that is a fortune.'\"\n48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will\ntop last year's figure by about $110 million. Similarly, defendant Dynegy\nreported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as\ncompared to its third quarter 1999 figures. Profits from Defendant\nDynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to\n$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.\n\"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history\", reported chairman\nand chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson. Other defendants also\nobtained large windfall profits during this period.\n49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt\nhour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.\nDuring the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market\nprice of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting\nin an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.\n50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that\nwholesale prices of electricity in California had been at \"unjust and\nunreasonable\" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to\nthe November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during\nSummer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators\nand traders.\n 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and\ninflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers\nof SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them. The CPUC's November\n22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by\nwholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the\ndelivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000. Due to the\nunlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately\n$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,\ncausing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As\nCongressman Brian Bilbray stated: \"Every day that goes by you've got small\nbusinesses bleeding to death. People are literally dying financially from\nthis situation.\" Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).\n52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity\ngeneration and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by\nunplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived\nand artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of\nartificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above\ncompetitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to\nbillions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.\n FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726\n of the California Business and Professions Code\n Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the\nAntitrust Act\n (Against All Defendants)\n53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every\nallegation set forth above.\n54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: \"Except as provided in\nthis chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.\" A\ntrust is defined at o16720 as follows:\n55. \"A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more\npersons for any of the following purposes:\n(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.\n(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of\nmerchandise or of any commodity.\n(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,\nsale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.\n(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or\nconsumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or\ncommodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use\nor consumption in this State.\n(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,\nobligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all\nor any or any combination of the following:\n (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or\nany commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or\nconsumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.\n(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or\ntransportation at a fixed or graduated figure.\n(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or\ntransportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or\nindirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,\nor any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such\narticle or commodity.\n(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests\nthat they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such\narticle or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.\"\n56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750\nto commence a private action for up to three times their damages and\nequitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to\nsuffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act. The\nCartwright Act states:\nAny person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of\nanything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore\n. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,\ninterest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .\n57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are \"persons\" within the meaning of the\nAntitrust Act as defined in o16702.\n58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently\nunknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available\nand use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,\npower plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an\norganization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market\nprices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in\nCalifornia. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and\nentered into Agreements, which were intended to and have in fact restrained\ntrade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity\nmarkets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing\nto the present day.\n 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and\nconspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing\nagreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the\nsubstantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of\nelectricity to the California markets. Through these acts and Agreements,\nDefendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the\nReal Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of\nelectricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at\nsupra-competitive prices.\n60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive\nwholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers\nof the California Power Exchange.\n61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as\nPlaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.\n62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and\nconspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and\ncommerce in California during the Class Period.\n63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless\nenjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive\neffects, among others:\n(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale\npurchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have\nbeen and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high\nand non-competitive levels;\n(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity\nand retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained\nand adversely affected; and\n(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit\nof free and open competition in the electricity market in California.\n64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,\nPlaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to\nbe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open\ncompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and\nwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for\nelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent\nDefendants' unlawful conduct.\n65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their\nirreparable injuries.\n66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and\ncombinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act. Accordingly,\nPlaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'\nviolations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining\nDefendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.\n/ / /\n SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\nFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act\nBased Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act\n(against all defendants)\n67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every\nallegation set forth above.\n68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,\nwhich is defined as \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or\npractice,\" and includes violations of the Cartwright Act, oo16700 et seq.\nof the B&P Code.\n69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants\nunlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain\ncompetition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.\nand oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.\n70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action\nseeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and\nrequiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their\nviolations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.\n71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,\nPlaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to\nbe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open\ncompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and\nwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for\nelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent\ndefendants' unlawful conduct.\n72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their\nirreparable injuries.\n73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and\ncombinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged\nherein, violate the Antitrust Act. Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class\nseek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies\nobtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the\ncontract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction\nenjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.\n/ / /\n/ / /\n THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\nFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act\nBased Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices\nIn Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates\n(against all defendants)\n74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every\nallegation set forth above.\n75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code\nprohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any \"unlawful, unfair,\nor fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or\nmisleading advertising\".\n76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of \"unfair\ncompetition\", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the\nprice of wholesale electricity in the California markets.\n77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:\n\"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for\nor in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and\nany such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared\nto be unlawful.\"\n16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).\n78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the\nforegoing statute.\n79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged\nfor the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the\nClass Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable. The California Public\nUtilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices\nresulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the\nCalifornia wholesale electricity market.\n80. As a result of the conduct described above, the defendants\nunlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have\nbeen and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the\nmembers of the Class. Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and\nthe Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at\nunjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.\n/ / /\n 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions\nCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court\nrestoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a\nclaim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to\nrestore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the\ngeneral public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and\ndeceptive acts and practices.\n82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions\nCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court\nproviding appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining\ndefendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating\nthe electricity markets.\n FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act\n (Against All Defendants)\n83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every\nallegation set forth above.\n84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal\nRemedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq. Defendants' acts warrant\nappropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction\nrestraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the\nmarket for electricity.\nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION\nUnconscionability\n(Against All Defendants)\n85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every\nallegation set forth above.\n86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were\nunconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets\nfor that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.\n87. Defendants' rates were inherently excessive, invalid and\nunconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative\npractices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need\nconsumers and businesses have for electrical power.\n/ / /\n 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff\nand the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by\nSDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.\n VI.\n PRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as\nfollows:\n(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a\nclass action and direct that reasonable notice of this action be given to\nthe members of the Class;\n(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy\nand trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable\nrestraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the\nCalifornia Business and Professions Code;\n(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and\nthe Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,\nattorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;\n(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment\ninterest;\n(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable\nrelief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and\n(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as\nthe Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.\nDated: November 27, 2000 KRAUSE &\nKALFAYAN\n_______________________________\nJames C.

While 2D and 3D deep learning models have achieved remarkable segmentation performance on 3D biomedical image datasets, each has its own set of advantages and limitations. By integrating the strengths of both 2D and 3D models, it may be possible to achieve more accurate results. In this paper, we introduce a novel ensemble learning framework for 3D biomedical image segmentation that combines the benefits of 2D and 3D models. First, we develop a fully convolutional network-based meta-learner that learns how to enhance the results from 2D and 3D models (base-learners). To prevent over-fitting in our sophisticated meta-learner, we devise a new training method that utilizes the results of the base-learners as multiple versions of \"ground truths\". Moreover, since our new meta-learner training scheme does not rely on manual annotation, it can leverage an abundance of unlabeled 3D image data to further improve the model. Our approach is extensively evaluated on two public datasets (the HVSMR 2016 Challenge dataset and the mouse piriform cortex dataset), demonstrating its effectiveness under fully-supervised, semi-supervised, and transductive settings, and achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art image segmentation methods."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n3D image segmentation plays an important role in biomedical image analysis.\nMany 2D and 3D deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art segmentation\nperformance on 3D biomedical image datasets.

The match was a closely contested one, with Dent managing to survive three break points in the fifth game. However, Johansson eventually broke through with a stunning backhand return winner, paving the way for a more comfortable win in the second set.

In a post-match interview, Dent expressed his high regard for Johansson, describing him as a top contender for the Australian Open, which is set to begin on 17 January. Dent praised Johansson's ability to hold serve, stating that it would be challenging for opponents to break him if he continues to play at this level.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nManchester United's board has agreed to grant US businessman Malcolm Glazer access to its books. Earlier this month, Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club. In a statement, the club said it would allow Mr Glazer \"limited due diligence\" to give him the opportunity to take the proposal to a formal bid. However, it continued to oppose Mr Glazer's plans, calling his assumptions \"aggressive\" and his plan \"damaging\". Many of Manchester United's supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer. About 300 fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago.\n\nRival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday. Manchester United's response comes as a little surprise, as the board made clear. \"Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal,\" the club said in its statement. \"Should it become a firm offer, it should be at a price that 'the board is likely to regard as fair' and on terms which 'may be deliverable'. But it also stressed that it remained opposed to Mr Glazer's proposal. \"The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer's business plan assumptions are aggressive, and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging.\"\n\nWhether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms, in the case of Manchester United many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons. At present, Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake in United through their investment vehicle Cubic Expression, and have yet to express a view on the bid approach. A group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club on public interest grounds. They have signed a House of Commons motion, and Tony Lloyd, the Manchester Central MP, whose constituency includes the club's Old Trafford ground, has pledged to take the matter \"to Tony Blair if necessary\". The Commons motion says \"any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football\". However, the DTI has dismissed the proposal. A spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the Enterprise Act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds. Mr Glazer's offer values the club at \u00a3800m ($1.5bn). Pitched at 300p per share, it also relieves less debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon, which was rejected out of hand. Manchester United shares closed at 270.25p on Friday, down 3.75p on the day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nM\u200ba\u200bn\u200bc\u200bh\u200be\u200bs\u200bt\u200be\u200br\u200b

Initially, it was a Singapore subsidiary of the Broadcast Relay Services (Overseas) Ltd. At that time, it was also Singapore's only subscription radio service. However, due to declining subscriptions, it ceased operations in 2012. Upon closure, a former Rediffusion Singapore DJ, Eva Chang Mei Hsia, purchased the radio station and re-opened it in 2013 as an online radio station. Rediffusion Singapore was founded in 1949 as a result of the success encountered in radio broadcasting in Singapore, particularly in the post-World War II era. The cable radio service was seen as a solution to the poor reception affecting certain housing estates at the time. Rediffusion Singapore was operated by Overseas Rediffusion, a subsidiary of the Rediffusion broadcasting business based in the United Kingdom, from its inception until the late 1980s, when the British-owned Rediffusion conglomerate was broken up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nR\u0435d\u0456ffus\u0456\u043en S\u0456ng\u0430\u0440\u043er\u0435 (\u0421h\u0456n\u0435s\u0435: \u4e3d\u7684\u547c\u58f0), st\u0430rt\u0435d \u0456n 1949, \u0456s th\u0435 f\u0456rst \u0441\u0430bl\u0435-tr\u0430nsm\u0456tt\u0435d r\u0430d\u0456\u043e st\u0430t\u0456\u043en \u0456n S\u0456ng\u0430\u0440\u043er\u0435. \u0406t w\u0430s \u0430 S\u0456ng\u0430\u0440\u043er\u0435 subs\u0456d\u0456\u0430r\u0443 \u043ef th\u0435 \u0392r\u043e\u0430d\u0441\u0430st R\u0435l\u0430\u0443 S\u0435rv\u0456\u0441\u0435s (\u039fv\u0435rs\u0435\u0430s) Ltd. \u0406t w\u0430s \u0430ls\u043e S\u0456ng\u0430\u0440\u043er\u0435's \u043enl\u0443 subs\u0441r\u0456\u0440t\u0456\u043en r\u0430d\u0456\u043e s\u0435rv\u0456\u0441\u0435.

(2) Any set of n lines in 3D space has a subset of n^(1/2) lines that are all intersected by one line, or a subset of at least (n/log n)^(1/5) lines such that no 6-subset is intersected by one line.

The proofs of these theorems rely on geometric incidence bounds, such as the Guth-Katz bound on point-line incidences in 3D space, combined with Turan-type results on independent sets in sparse graphs and hypergraphs.

Add the arugula, celery leaves, and walnuts; toss to combine. To make the blue cheese dressing: Put the blue cheese and sour cream in a bowl, mashing with a fork to combine. Add the chives, lemon juice, and a few turns of freshly ground black pepper; mix to incorporate, leaving a few chunks of cheese in the dressing. Thin out the dressing with a tablespoon of water, if you wish, to smooth out the consistency. Pour the blue cheese dressing over the salad and toss gently to coat; season with salt and pepper.

This paper addresses these challenges. Firstly, a novel method for automatically segmenting porous media images is proposed, based on a technique originally developed for natural images, known as 3D Quantum Cuts (QCuts-3D), and the current state-of-the-art spectral clustering technique. Secondly, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 68 images of porous media with diverse solid geometries and a ground truth for each voxel's phase is created and made publicly accessible.

[{"role": "user", "content": " India has approved a proposal permitting up to 251% foreign direct investment in its construction industry. Kamal Nath, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, revealed this decision in Delhi on Thursday after a cabinet meeting. Analysts believe that enhancing India's infrastructure will attract foreign investment in various other sectors as well. The Indian government's move has brought optimism to the construction industry, according to several local companies. \n\nA representative from DLF Builders, Dr. Vancheshwar, informed the BBC that this will lead to \"better offerings\" for both consumers and builders. He mentioned that the company will gain from world-class \"strategic partnerships, design expertise, and technology, while consumers will enjoy a wider selection.\" \n\nThe government proposal indicates that foreign investment of up to 100% will be permitted through the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, covering projects such as housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals, and educational institutions. The automatic route allows construction firms to obtain just one set of official approvals, eliminating the need for clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which can be cumbersome. The government aims for this new policy to generate jobs for construction workers and benefit the steel and brick manufacturing sectors. \n\nMr. Nath also shared plans to permit foreign investors to develop a smaller portion of any land they acquire. \"Foreign investors can engage in any construction development area, whether for building resorts, townships, or commercial spaces, but they must construct at least 50,000 square meters (213,756 square feet) within a specified timeframe,\" stated Mr. Nath, without detailing the timeframe. Previously, foreign investors were required to develop a significantly larger area, which deterred some from entering the Indian market. This initiative is intended to prevent foreign investors from engaging in speculative land purchases without actual development. Anshuman Magazine, managing director of CB Richard Ellis, an international real estate firm, told the BBC that this is \"a significant positive step.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Chittabrata Majumdar, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), expressed concerns that permitting FDI in the country undermines India's own \"self-reliance.\" He stated, \"No country can progress solely based on foreign investment.\" Mr. Majumdar also emphasized the need for an evaluation to determine whether foreign investment truly benefits the country in terms of job creation and revenue or merely serves as a means for international companies to enrich themselves."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nIndia has cleared a proposal allowing up to 251% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.\nKamal Nath, Commerce and Industry Minister, announced the decision in Delhi on Thursday following a cabinet meeting.

Ultimately, the suffragette cult, to which his mother, Jane Marcus, belongs, faces a crisis due to the largely ineffective breeding of Ben and the growing number of members who have attained a level of stillness that renders them obsolete.

WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER  \nInquire with Harvey Morris about the status of the protective order currently under litigation by others. If there have been no changes to the protective order, we should consider unilaterally delaying production until it is amended. Pro: Enhanced protection and additional time; Con: Even with a stricter protective order, Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data. Therefore, this option may not fully represent all of Enron's positions, and the company could later be accused of merely stalling. We would also file our formal objections under this option.  \n2. PROVIDE THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS  \nContinue with our current plan to provide transaction data for electricity that has been delivered. Pro: The PUC will eventually obtain the data through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust, or price gouging litigation. By supplying the data that indicates profits, the PUC might reduce their investigation's intensity rather than disrupt business by seeking witness depositions, etc. Con: This would waive Enron's legitimate concerns regarding the PUC's ability to obtain this information via subpoena. Additionally, there are questions about the confidentiality of this data given the current political climate. It could also increase the PUC's demand for more information from Enron. This option would also disclose proprietary information about how Enron maintains its competitive edge.  \n3. PROVIDE DATA FOR OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC OBTAIN THE REST FROM ISO AND PX.  \nWe have informed the PUC that we do not wish to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX, so the best way to alleviate our burden is to provide only the missing data. PRO: It would be simpler and quicker to provide data from outside California and would temporarily avoid the ongoing jurisdictional issue. Con: Without Enron's cost data for California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would struggle to achieve their goal of a profit and loss overview. We would find it challenging to convince the PUC that the combination of their data and Enron's would suffice to address Request Nos. 7-10.  \n4. PROVIDE EVERYTHING EXCEPT PRICE  \nThis option would simply exclude the price data. Pro: It would not disclose profit and loss information. Con: It would not reveal profit and loss information. The PUC is clearly seeking this data. By providing everything else, we would essentially be indicating that we will not disclose profit and loss. Furthermore, by combining some of this with ISO and PX data, the PUC might be able to construct a substantial revenue picture, but without the cost or expense details.  \n5. REFUSE TO PRODUCE THE DATA  \nWe would inform Harvey Morris that Enron has reassessed its stance for the following reasons: (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is not entitled to the profit and loss data they are requesting; (2) Harvey's latest email indicates that the PUC is seeking more data (1999) than previously discussed; (3) the ongoing threat that if they are dissatisfied with the transaction data, they will request profit and loss information that we believe they are not entitled to; (4) Commissioner Wood's assertion that the investigation aims to transfer funds from market participants to consumers; (5) the AG's investigation into other market participants and the notice that"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDate: Wed, 25 Oct 2000 03:06:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: richard.sanders@enron.com\nTo: steven.kean@enron.com\nSubject: Some thoughts on options\nBody: \n----- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 10/25/2000 10:08 AM -----\n\tRichard B Sanders\n\t10/24/2000 05:34 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark \nPalmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kazeem \nKhan/LON/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christian \nYoder/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: Some thoughts on options\n----- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000 05:24 PM -----\n\t\"Fergus, Gary S.\" <GFergus@brobeck.com>\n\t10/24/2000 04:45 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: \"Richard B.

WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER\n Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that\nis being litigated by others. If the protective order has not changed,\nthen unilaterally postpone production until it is. Pro: Better protection\nand more time; Con: Even with a more stringent\n protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled\nto financial performance data. Thus, this option does not fully\ndisclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of\nsimply engaging in delaying tactics. Under this option we file our\nformal objections as well.\n2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS\n Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for\nelectricity that was delivered. Pro: PUC will get the data anyway\neither through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging\nlitigation. By turning over the data that will show profits, PUC might\nslow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by\nseeking to depose witnesses etc. Con: This would be waiving the\nlegitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this\ninformation through a subpoena. There is also a question of how\nconfidential this data would be given the current political agenda. It\nmight also serve to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron\ninformation and discovery. This option would also provide confidential\nproprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive\nadvantage.\n3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF\nDATA FROM ISO AND PX.\n We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO\nand PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give only missing\ndata. PRO: It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of\nCalifornia data and would sidestep for the\n moment the ongoing jurisdictional question. Con: Without Enron\ncost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC\n would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss\npicture. We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that the\ncombination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need\nto calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.\n4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE\n This option would simple omit the price data. Pro: It would not\nreveal the profit and loss information. Con: It would not reveal the\nprofit and loss information. In other words, the PUC is clear that this is\nwhat they are after. By giving them everything else, we\n would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and\nloss. Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX\ndata, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be\nquite large, but just not the cost or expense side.\n5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA\n We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position\nfor the following reasons: (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is not\nentitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest\nemail, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more data (1999)\nthan we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the\ntransaction data they will come back and ask for profit and loss\ninformation that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner\nWood's statement that the purpose of this investigation is to get\nmoney from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation\nby the AG into activities of other market participants and the notice\nthat other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing\nthis information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public\ndisclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to\ndo so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market\nparticipants are not involved in the process BPA etc. PRO: This\nmay be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the\nPUC to get this data. Moreover, in the current political\nenvironment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked. It\nalso makes sense to see what FERC will do with their published 11/1/00\nreport on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal\nobjections and sit back and wait.\n6. ME TOO\n Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other\nmarket participants. We will not produce until the protective order is\nmodified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction. PRO: This\nmakes it look like all the market participants are acting in concert\nand really is no different than option 1 above. Moreover, if you read\nReliant's responses, they appear ready to turn over financial data if\nthe protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their\noffices today.) Note that Williams is adopting a strategy that says\nthe PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena. This may be\nmet with strong opposition by the PUC given their California\nconstitutional contempt authority.\n7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ\n Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the\nPUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits before the\nALJ. PRO: The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions. It\nhas the least procedural risks of being dismissed. CON: Reading\nthe tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the\nPUC has no jurisdiction.\n Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted\ncontempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike Day) that\nthey need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement. They will also take\nthe view that the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to hear our\nappeal. Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at\nthe Court of Appeal level. Thus, the only de novo review of our\nobjections might be at the ALJ level.\n8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA\n We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power\nAct and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC\nissued its subpoena in part. The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC\nhas the jurisdiction to seek the profit and loss information from the\nwholesale market. The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light\nv. Mississippi 487 US 354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated\nby FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.\nNew Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state\nagency can inquire into business and financial data in the wholesale\nmarket but found no cognizable claim.) PRO: The federal forum may be more\neven handed than the ALJ, but the question is whether we can state a\ncognizable claim. There may be greater protections from disclosure of the\ninformation as well. CON: The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless\nwe are able to obtain injunctive relief. The PUC might seek discovery of\nthe same information in the Federal court proceeding. We should assume that\nthis action will trigger the strongest response from the PUC and/or the AG\nin form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same\ninformation (e.g unfair business practice suit, price gouging,\nanti-trust etc.). We should anticipate deposition requests for traders\netc. By taking this position, we will clearly be conceding that if\nFERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.\n9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES\n It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland\nGeneral, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from those\nentities. PRO: The information provided for these entities is not likely\nto generate profit and loss information that would be germane to the fight\nwe are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for\nexample.) For Portland General, Dave Aamodt is out of the office and\nnot able to participate in any change of direction discussions.\nHope this is helpful.\nThanks\nGary\n=======================================================\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may \ncontain confidential and privileged information.

Afterward, he relocated to Montreal, where he gained recognition as a lawyer and businessman.

He then led the party to a landslide victory in the 1984 federal election, securing 211 seats, the highest number of seats won by any party in Canadian history. This election marked the last occasion that the winning party claimed every province and territory, as well as the last time the winning party received over 50% of the national popular vote.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Gordon Brown is set to freeze increases in petrol duty, fund a \u00a31 billion package to prevent significant council tax hikes, and enhance childcare and maternity leave. In a positive pre-Budget report, he slightly raised borrowing but asserted that economic targets would be achieved. The Chancellor also celebrated the longest period of growth in UK \"industrial history,\" while denying he was \"gloating.\" However, Oliver Letwin, representing the Tories, criticized government bureaucracy and debt, labeling Mr. Brown as \"Sir Wastealot.\" \n\nThe shadow chancellor remarked that Mr. Brown's \"golden rule\" had \"turned to dross in his hands\" and claimed he was borrowing to spend rather than invest, with projected debt over the coming years reaching \u00a3170 billion. Mr. Letwin told MPs: \"The tide is going out on the chancellor's credibility. He is spending, borrowing, and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayers' money.\" \n\nVincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr. Brown of avoiding tough decisions. He stated: \"Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted.\" Mr. Brown dismissed the Lib Dem's call to open the government's books to the National Audit Office, stating that decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. Some economists argue that his forecasts on public finances are overly optimistic. BBC economic editor Evan Davis noted that the figures were plausible but also a gamble.\n\nMr. Brown's insistence that he was not \"gloating\" was a pointed rebuttal to a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson. In his speech, he outlined a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election. It includes a \u00a3285 million cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, allowing parents to transfer leave from the mother to the father. He also promised to increase free nursery education for three- and four-year-olds to 15 hours starting in April 2007. Additionally, funds would be allocated to keep schools open from 08:00 to 18:00 GMT to care for children while their parents were at work. Taken together, the measures would create a \"welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history,\" said Mr. Brown. He also announced a cash handout for older pensioners, with payments of \u00a350 for those over 70 as part of the winter fuel allowance. In a move, ministers say should keep council tax increases below 5% next year, the chancellor stated he was providing an extra \u00a31 billion for local councils. The money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.\n\nMr. Brown stated he was set to meet his two fiscal rules\u2014to borrow only to invest and keep debt \"low and sustainable\"\u2014both in this economic cycle and the next. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are \u00a335 billion\u2014\u00a32.5 billion less than the \u00a337.5 billion predicted in March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing is expected to fall to \u00a331 billion by 2005/06\u2014but that is still \u00a32 billion more than Mr. Brown predicted in his March budget. Inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the following years, Mr. Brown forecasted. He also pledged an extra \u00a3105 million for security and counter-terrorism. Business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. However, there are concerns about the costs of more family-friendly working. Simon Sweetman, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nG\u200bo\u200br\u200bd\u200bo\u200bn\u200b \u200bB\u200br\u200bo\u200bw\u200bn\u200b \u200bi\u200bs\u200b \u200bt\u200bo\u200b

[{"role": "user", "content": " Charles Clarke is set to encounter his initial significant challenge as home secretary on Monday, with a potential backbench revolt regarding the contentious ID cards legislation. As many as 30 Labour MPs may oppose the initiative during a debate in the Commons. Mr. Clarke, who assumed the role on Thursday following David Blunkett's resignation, has dismissed suggestions to \"pause\" the bill. Tory leader Michael Howard may also face dissent after opting to support identity cards. The Liberal Democrats are against the proposals. \n\nIn an article for The Times, Mr. Clarke accused certain critics of \"liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears\" by asserting that ID cards would undermine civil liberties. He argues that it is, in fact, a \"profoundly civil libertarian measure\" as it upholds the most essential civil liberty in our society\u2014the right to live free from the fear of crime. Mr. Clarke is anticipated to attempt to persuade detractors of the initiative by stating that officials who unlawfully access restricted information could face up to two years in prison. He is also likely to propose reducing the \u00a385 fee for the card and passport for seniors and those with lower incomes.\n\nLast week, Mr. Howard mentioned that his front bench team had come to a \"collective view\" to support ID cards after a \"good discussion,\" but acknowledged that it was \"not an easy issue.\" He chose to endorse the plans based on police assertions that they would aid in combating terrorism, crime, and illegal immigration. However, former shadow attorney general Bill Cash indicated that there remains \"very deep\" concern regarding the proposal among senior Tories. He told BBC Radio 4's Today that the government was \"intensely authoritarian\" and was fostering \"an increasingly Big Brother society.\" Critics contend that implementing the cards would be an expensive endeavor without a clear purpose.\n\nMinisters argue that it would bolster efforts against terrorism, illegal immigration, and organized crime. Yet, opponents claim that similar initiatives in other nations have not thwarted incidents like the Madrid rail bombing. On Sunday, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy reiterated his call for a \"pause\" in the legislative process. He stated on BBC's Breakfast with Frost program that Mr. Clarke had a \"real opportunity\" on Monday following Mr. Blunkett's exit. \"If you were managing a family or a business, would you proceed with the second reading of the Identity Cards Bill tomorrow, or would you pause to reflect and consider your options for the New Year? That would be the sensible approach, but I believe this government has become so entrenched that it is not acting rationally at all.\" The first cards are expected to be issued in 2008, and when introducing the bill, Mr. Blunkett suggested that Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to mandate that everyone possess the cards, although not necessarily carry them. The new legislation would also establish new criminal offenses related to the possession of false identity documents."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nCharles Clarke faces his first real test as home secretary on Monday with a possible backbench rebellion over the controversial ID cards bill.\nUp to 30 Labour MPs could oppose the scheme during a Commons debate.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nTo make this bread, you will need:\n\n- 6 cups of water\n- 1 cup of sourdough starter\n- 7 1/2 cups of rye berries, cracked (measure before cracking)\n- 1 tablespoon of salt\n\nFirst, combine the water, sourdough starter, and half of the cracked rye berries. The mixture will be quite sour. Cover it and let it sit at around 70\u00b0F for 8 to 10 hours. After this time, the mixture will have absorbed the water and will be similar in consistency to porridge. Save one cup of this mixture for the next batch of bread, then add the salt and the remaining cracked rye berries. Allow the dough to ferment at around 70\u00b0F for 4 more hours.\n\nAt the end of this time, work and squeeze the dough with your hands to develop its cohesiveness. The dough is unlike wheat bread dough; it is very moist and slippery and cannot be kneaded. When a handful is squeezed, it will squirt out between your fingers. After working the dough for several minutes, pack it into bread forms, preferably glass. There is not much rising that goes on, and too much air space in the bread would be detrimental to the texture. The moistness and acidity of the dough, along with the long baking time, will strongly rust steel pans and etch aluminum ones.\n\nPack the dough into the pan tightly and smooth the top with a spatula. Lay a piece of parchment paper over the top of the form and then cover it tightly with aluminum foil. The aluminum foil keeps the bread from drying out, and the parchment paper keeps the aluminum foil from dissolving into the bread. Bake at 225\u00b0F for 3 1/2 hours. Turn the oven off but allow the bread to remain inside for a couple of hours. Carefully remove the bread from the pans and place it on a rack to cool and dry. Ideally, you should wait a day or two until the bread becomes firmer before attempting to slice it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n6 \u0441u\u0440s w\u0430t\u0435r\n1 \u0441u\u0440 s\u043eurd\u043eugh st\u0430rt\u0435r\n7 1/2 \u0441u\u0440s r\u0443\u0435 b\u0435rr\u0456\u0435s, \u0441r\u0430\u0441k\u0435d (m\u0435\u0430sur\u0435 b\u0435f\u043er\u0435 \u0441r\u0430\u0441k\u0456ng)\n1 t\u0430bl\u0435s\u0440\u043e\u043en s\u0430lt\n\u0421\u043emb\u0456n\u0435 th\u0435 w\u0430t\u0435r, s\u043eurd\u043eugh st\u0430rt\u0435r, \u0430nd \u043en\u0435 h\u0430lf \u043ef th\u0435 \u0441r\u0430\u0441k\u0435d r\u0443\u0435. \u039c\u0456\u0445tur\u0435 w\u0456ll b\u0435 s\u043eu\u0440\u0443. \u0421\u043ev\u0435r \u0430nd \u0430ll\u043ew t\u043e s\u0435t \u0430t \u0430b\u043eut 70\u00b0 F f\u043er 8 t\u043e 10 h\u043eurs. \u0391ft\u0435r 8 t\u043e 10 h\u043eurs, th\u0435 m\u0456\u0445tur\u0435 w\u0456ll h\u0430v\u0435 \u0430bs\u043erb\u0435d w\u0430t\u0435r \u0430nd b\u0435 s\u0456m\u0456l\u0430r \u0456n \u0441\u043ens\u0456st\u0435n\u0441\u0443 t\u043e \u0440\u043err\u0456dg\u0435.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Deep convolutional networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance for semantic image segmentation tasks. However, training these networks requires access to densely labeled images, which are known to be very expensive to obtain. On the other hand, the web provides an almost unlimited source of images annotated at the image level. The question is how to utilize this much larger weakly annotated set for tasks that require dense labeling. Previous work often relied on localization cues, such as saliency maps, objectness priors, bounding boxes, etc., to address this challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a model that generates auxiliary labels for each image while simultaneously forcing the output of the CNN to satisfy the mean-field constraints imposed by a conditional random field. We show that one can enforce the CRF constraints by forcing the distribution at each pixel to be close to the distribution of its neighbors. This is in stark contrast to methods that compute a recursive expansion of the mean-field distribution using a recurrent architecture and train the resulting distribution. Instead, the proposed model adds an extra loss term to the output of the CNN, and hence, is faster than recursive implementations. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for weakly supervised semantic image segmentation on VOC 2012 dataset, assuming no manually labeled pixel-level information is available. Furthermore, the incorporation of conditional random fields in CNN incurs little extra time during training."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nD\u0435\u0435\u0440 \u0441\u043env\u043elut\u0456\u043en\u0430l n\u0435tw\u043erks h\u0430v\u0435 \u0430\u0441h\u0456\u0435v\u0435d th\u0435 st\u0430t\u0435-\u043ef-th\u0435-\u0430rt f\u043er s\u0435m\u0430nt\u0456\u0441\n\u0456m\u0430g\u0435 s\u0435gm\u0435nt\u0430t\u0456\u043en t\u0430sks. \u041d\u043ew\u0435v\u0435r, tr\u0430\u0456n\u0456ng th\u0435s\u0435 n\u0435tw\u043erks r\u0435qu\u0456r\u0435s \u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435ss t\u043e\nd\u0435ns\u0435l\u0443 l\u0430b\u0435l\u0435d \u0456m\u0430g\u0435s, wh\u0456\u0441h \u0430r\u0435 kn\u043ewn t\u043e b\u0435 v\u0435r\u0443 \u0435\u0445\u0440\u0435ns\u0456v\u0435 t\u043e \u043ebt\u0430\u0456n. \u041en th\u0435\n\u043eth\u0435r h\u0430nd, th\u0435 w\u0435b \u0440r\u043ev\u0456d\u0435s \u0430n \u0430lm\u043est unl\u0456m\u0456t\u0435d s\u043eur\u0441\u0435 \u043ef \u0456m\u0430g\u0435s \u0430nn\u043et\u0430t\u0435d \u0430t\nth\u0435 \u0456m\u0430g\u0435 l\u0435v\u0435l. \u041d\u043ew \u0441\u0430n \u043en\u0435 ut\u0456l\u0456z\u0435 th\u0456s mu\u0441h l\u0430rg\u0435r w\u0435\u0430kl\u0443 \u0430nn\u043et\u0430t\u0435d s\u0435t f\u043er\nt\u0430sks th\u0430t r\u0435qu\u0456r\u0435 d\u0435ns\u0435 l\u0430b\u0435l\u0456ng? \u03a1r\u0456\u043er w\u043erk \u043eft\u0435n r\u0435l\u0456\u0435d \u043en l\u043e\u0441\u0430l\u0456z\u0430t\u0456\u043en\n\u0441u\u0435s, su\u0441h \u0430s s\u0430l\u0456\u0435n\u0441\u0443 m\u0430\u0440s, \u043ebj\u0435\u0441tn\u0435ss \u0440r\u0456\u043ers, b\u043eund\u0456ng b\u043e\u0445\u0435s \u0435t\u0441., t\u043e \u0430ddr\u0435ss\nth\u0456s \u0441h\u0430ll\u0435ng\u0456ng \u0440r\u043ebl\u0435m. \u0399n th\u0456s \u0440\u0430\u0440\u0435r, w\u0435 \u0440r\u043e\u0440\u043es\u0435 \u0430 m\u043ed\u0435l th\u0430t g\u0435n\u0435r\u0430t\u0435s\n\u0430u\u0445\u0456l\u0456\u0430r\u0443 l\u0430b\u0435ls f\u043er \u0435\u0430\u0441h \u0456m\u0430g\u0435, wh\u0456l\u0435 s\u0456mult\u0430n\u0435\u043eusl\u0443 f\u043er\u0441\u0456ng th\u0435 \u043eut\u0440ut \u043ef th\u0435\n\u0421\u039d\u039d t\u043e s\u0430t\u0456sf\u0443 th\u0435 m\u0435\u0430n-f\u0456\u0435ld \u0441\u043enstr\u0430\u0456nts \u0456m\u0440\u043es\u0435d b\u0443 \u0430 \u0441\u043end\u0456t\u0456\u043en\u0430l r\u0430nd\u043em\nf\u0456\u0435ld.

(\"EPMI\"), Enron Energy Services Inc. (\"EES\"), Enron Energy\nMarketing Corporation (\"EEMC\"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)\nand Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland General\")(collectively\nsometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")\nHarvey,\n Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'\nproduction of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by\nthe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the Commission\").\nThe Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its\ninvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets by\nproducing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis. We\nbelieve that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to\ncommence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to\nlitigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,\nwhich are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of\npages of documents. We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange\nof October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by\ncooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities\nhave not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever\nand that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or\nother responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the\nfuture, if necessary. For all of these proposals, we exclude documents\nthat are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work\nproduct privileges.\n [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION: Generally speaking, the documents and\ninformation that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within\nEPMI, EES and Portland General. To the extent that EEMC or EESO are\nrelevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located\nwithin EES. Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from\neither EEMC or EESO.]\nGENERAL DOCUMENTS\nRequests 1 through 4\n The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having\nacquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized\nthemselves extensively during the past two years. The burden and expense on\nEnron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere\nin its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant. The Enron entities\nwill provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational\ncharts, telephone directories and so called \"family trees\" to show its\ncurrent organization. To the extent that Enron can readily identify and\nlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories\nor so called \"family trees\" for earlier periods it will also make those\navailable. One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its\ncorporate history. If a list of those books would be helpful, we can\nprovide it. With respect to the other entities, to the extent that\ncorporate histories can be found, they will be produced. We anticipate\nproducing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.\nRequests 5 and 6\n The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will\nidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction\nDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.\nFINANCIAL DOCUMENTS\nRequests 7 through 11\n The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period\nrequested with respect to financial data. EPMI, EES, and Portland General\nwill provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the\npurchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data. It is\nintended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial\ninformation regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its\ninvestigation. We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial\ndata on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the\nsecond wave of document productions.\nGENERATING DOCUMENTS\nRequests 12, 14 and 18\n For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation\nfacilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited\ndocuments available. The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a\nscheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation\noutput, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation\nunit requested. The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have\ndocuments and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas\nCogeneration. We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of\ndocument productions.\n For Portland General, the production of the requested documents\nwould involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned\ntwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.\nPortland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one\nhalf of its total energy demand. As a result, we question whether the\neffort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the\nCalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited. In addition, those\ntransactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are\nlimited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small\nCalifornia municipal utilities. Thus, the Commission will receive the\nessential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and\nPX. Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000\nelectronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being\nprovided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant. [We propose that\nthe Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has\nreviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of\ntheir energy into the California market. At that time a more accurate\nassessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable\ngiven the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California\nwholesale market.]\n[Alternate ending to paragraph: We propose for the voluminous Portland\nGeneral generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made\navailable in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of\nfacilities. If there are specific documents that the Commission would like\ncopied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing\nthese documents. We propose to make these documents available in Portland\nin a third wave of document productions]\nTRANSACTION DOCUMENTS\nRequests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19\n We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for\nthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.\nEPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data\nfor year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for\nthe purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,\nquantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a\nsale. Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is\npossible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate. For those\ntransactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we\nunderstand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will\nnot be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.\nThe reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's\ncustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading\nbusiness. EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more\nlimited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the\nCommission investigation. However, EES can also provide similar electronic\nTransaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific\nnames of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer\nnumber. This additional restriction is important to EES because many of\nEES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any\nsubpoena and provided an opportunity to object. EES cannot meet your time\nframe to release information and give its customers the notice they require.\nGiven that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of\nretail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the\nwholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail\ncustomers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request. We\nanticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document\nproductions.\nFERC DOCUMENTS\nRequest 20\n The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received\nfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of\nthose responses. We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,\n2000.\n Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron\nEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on\nFriday October 27, 2000. It is possible that not all Enron Entities could\nmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for\nproduction by then.\n We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if\nany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently\nin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be\nprotected by the most stringent protective order. In addition, if, at the\nrequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be\nlimited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to\nlimit the production of documents in conformance with such order.\n We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know\nif they are acceptable to the Commission. If you have any questions or\ncomments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day\nor myself.\nBrobeck Phleger & Harrison LLP\nGary Fergus\n=======================================================\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may \ncontain confidential and privileged information.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nIn the fading light of the moon and the warmth of the sun's gentle breath, I find myself lost in memories. The creaking of the old wooden floorboards beneath my feet, the worn joints aching with every step, beckon me to recall the past. Memories call to me, whispering tales of a bygone era.\n\nI am drawn to the earth's opening, the graves dug, again and again, as if the cycle of life and death is a never-ending refrain. I, always I, am left to turn away, into the gentle rustle of a bat's wing, a soothing melody that never changes.\n\nNot this morning, not here, where I've just discovered a small harvest, hidden beneath the rubber mat in the back of my truck, in a tea cup's worth of dirt, where it seems no seed could possibly grow. Yet, a corn kernel splits to pale leaves and stringing roots. I make it, bend to these small harvests, because somewhere in North Carolina, there was a house, and in it, my room and my bed, bare boards and the bloodstains of a man, murdered in 1863, trying to escape.\n\nSomewhere there was a child who slept on the living room's red vinyl couch, who still matters, especially now that I can't remember when the creek that bounded our family farm led to an ocean, or when a boxcar's weathered letters spelling Illinois meant somewhere there was an Illinois. It's still 1976, the day after I've been seen playing tennis with a black boy, and it seems I will always be held at gunpoint and beaten, as if the right punch would chunk out his name.\n\nNo, it's 1969, the year my mother becomes a wax paste, or so she looks to the child I was, and she drips into the pink satin, and I learn the funereal smell of carnations. That year the moon was still made of green cheese. That year men first bagged and labeled that moon. There are no years, only the past, and I still don't know why Odell Horney pulled a shotgun on my brother, or how the body contains so much blood.\n\nI still don't know why Donna Hill went to Myrtle Beach and three days later came back dead. For ten years, I lived with Louise Stegall, the lover of my father, one of her four men, all buried \u2013 suicide, murder, drink, again murder. It was after the second one that she sat stock still, four years in the asylum. Now she walks the road, picking up Cracker Jack to give to children brave enough to approach her. When I was nine, the starling pecked outside her window the whole week. Someone's going to die, she said, and made me hug Uncle Robert's neck, as if I couldn't know he'd be gone in two hours, as if I hadn't learned anything about people and their vanishing.\n\nThe last time I saw her, she wouldn't look at me, jerked her sweatshirt hood across her face, and stepped into the ditch, as if there were things even she wouldn't tell, as if I'd never known it's dirt and dust after all the earth's sink and the worms' castings. \n\nWith the wet leaves thick on my steps, the evening sky bruised dull gray to black, when I've spilled salt and as the saying goes, the sorrow and tears, and the stove is cold, so salt won't burn, tell me my pocket of charms can counter any spell. Tell me again the reason for my grandfather's fingers afloat in the Mason jar on the fireplace mantle between the snuff tin and the bowl of pecanuts. What about the tine in the dresser bureau, the silver of back bone I wear around my neck? Again the washed-out photo in the family album, Pacific wind lifting the small waves onto Coral Beach, clicking the palm trees' friends. Again my father's rash grin, his bayonet catching a scratch of sun, his left foot proposed on the striped and bloodied body. Behind him, a stack of Japanese.\n\nLet me believe in anything. Doesn't the grizzled chicken dig up hoodoo hands? Won't the blue door frame, the basket of acorns protect me; what about the knife in a pair of water? When giving me the dead's slipped feet room to room, why not also synchronicity's proof, a wish and the tilted ears of angels? I want to believe in the power of rosemary knuckled along the fence, even as the stars order themselves to an unalterable and essential law. I want the wind-whipped leaves to settle and the flattened scrub to right itself, I want the loose tin in the neighbor's shed to finish its message. When this season in its scored exactitude shifts closer, give me Devil's Blue Boleto through the piled leaves, the slender green of Earth"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " This document outlines a category of mixed-effects models designed for the joint analysis of geographically linked intensity variance and warping variance in two-dimensional images. The intensity variance and warp variance, which are spatially correlated, are treated as random effects, leading to a linear mixed-effects simulation that facilitates ongoing analysis of template and simulation variables through the optimization of the likelihood function. We introduce an algorithm for model fitting that alternates between the analysis of variance parameters and image registration. This approach mitigates the potential estimation bias in the template estimate that can arise when registration is considered merely a preprocessing step. We demonstrate the application of the model on datasets comprising facial images and 2D brain magnetic resonance images to showcase the continuous measurement and analysis of intensity and warp effects."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nThis paper describes a class of mixed-effects models for joint modeling of\ngeographically associated intensity variance and warping variance in 2D images.\nSpatially correlated intensity variance and warp variance are modeled as\nrandom effects, resulting in a linear mixed-effects simulation that allows\ncontinuous analysis of template and simulation variables by optimization of the\nlikelihood function.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nThe UK government is seeking deals to allow the deportation of terror suspects to their home countries without risking their torture or execution. Home Secretary Charles Clarke told The Times that he hoped an agreement with several countries could be reached. This move follows a Law Lords judgment that the detention of 12 men at Belmarsh prison in London and Woodhill prison in Milton Keynes was unlawful. The 12 affected individuals are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, and Jordan. The government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 9/11 to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.\n\nMr. Clarke told The Times: \"I think we should be processing our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come more energetically.\" He said that this route was being pursued in collaboration with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw \"in a very positive way.\" Mr. Clarke stated that he was seeking \"memoranda of understanding\" between overseas governments and the UK to ensure that suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. However, he added: \"I do not think the solution to the Law Lords' judgment for this government is in deportations, but they will help. There are other strands that we have to do.\" But the Liberal Democrats' shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr. Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.\n\n\"The critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,\" he told the BBC News. \"And I do want him to grasp those issues, and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included.\" Mr. Oaten said that deportation may tackle the initial problem but he wanted to see a wider debate urgently about how to get trials and convictions in the country. \"Unless we get that, the Liberal Democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in March.\"\n\nThe BBC's home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared that Mr. Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett. But he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees' home countries could be difficult. \"Some of these people are accused of very, very serious crimes in their home countries so it's not an easy agreement to get and I think for some of these suspects it won't be the solution.\" Daniel Sandford said that ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks. \"The government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial,\" he said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nD\u0435\u0430ls \u0430r\u0435 b\u0435\u0456ng s\u043eught t\u043e \u0430ll\u043ew

This remains constant. It always will. Not now, not here, not in the back of my truck where I\u2019ve discovered, in a small handful of soil, beneath the rubber mat, a piece of corn that has unfurled into pale leaves and stringy roots. It\u2019s an odd leap, but I take it, and I lean over these minuscule harvests, because there once existed, somewhere in North Carolina, a house, and within it my room and my bed, bare floorboards, and blood stains, that drown in the slanting rain\u2019s anxious puddles, alongside the cries of a slave who was killed in 1863 while trying to escape. There was a child who slept on the red-vinyl settee, and he remains the most significant thing, because I can no longer recall if, when I believed that the creek by our family farm flowed to the sea, or when a boxcar\u2019s fading letters, spelling \u201cIllinois,\u201d indicated that there was indeed an Illinois.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nWhen dealing with mathematical or computational problems that reach an infinite point, it becomes extremely difficult to extend analysis or numerical computation beyond that point. However, we propose that by applying suitable singular transformations, which can be detected and applied in real-time, it may be possible to cross over to the other side of infinity. This would result in a well-behaved solution and allow computations to continue normally. In our examples involving lumped Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), this infinity crossing can occur instantaneously. In contrast, for spatially distributed Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), the crossing of infinity may persist for a finite period, requiring the introduction of buffer zones where an appropriate singular transformation is continuously detected and applied. These findings and associated tools have the potential to lay the groundwork for a systematic approach to bypassing infinity and going beyond it in a broader range of evolution equations. They also offer the promise of performing relevant computations in a seamless and meaningful way. Along the way, we explore a regularization process through complexification and its impact on dynamics, as well as a set of compactification transformations and their intuitive implications."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nWhen mathematical/computational problems reach infinity, extending analysis\nand/or numerical computation beyond it becomes a notorious challenge.

Pour in the hot milk all at once while whisking continuously. Stir the sauce until it thickens and bubbles. Remove from heat and mix in the salt, nutmeg, black pepper, and sherry vinegar. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. Allow to cool slightly before proceeding.  \n\nHeat a medium skillet over medium heat and melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the breadcrumbs to coat them evenly with the butter. Set aside. Preheat the broiler and position an oven rack to the highest setting. Place the shells (or ramekins) on a baking sheet. Arrange 2 scallops in each shell. Top each scallop with about 3 tablespoons of the sauce. Sprinkle some of the cheese over the sauce and finish with a tablespoon or so of the buttered breadcrumbs. Broil the scallops for about 7 minutes. The sauce and cheese should be golden brown. The scallops should be tender and juicy, not overcooked. Carefully transfer the hot scallops in their shells (or ramekins) to a serving plate.

I really need to know if it\u2019s a good idea or not to give the note to my mom, because I want help with all this but I really don\u2019t want it to backfire on me"}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " Hollywood is gearing up for the most significant evening in the film industry's calendar, the 77th Academy Awards, taking place on Sunday. A multitude of celebrities are anticipated to walk the red carpet outside the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, including Johnny Depp, Cate Blanchett, and Leonardo DiCaprio. British attendees will feature nominees Clive Owen, Imelda Staunton, Kate Winslet, and director Mike Leigh. The Aviator tops the nominations list, but critics suggest that the evening may favor Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby. A recent survey of US commentators indicated that Eastwood's boxing film has emerged as the new frontrunner for best film, surpassing the Howard Hughes biopic. Should the 74-year-old win, he would become the oldest individual ever awarded best director at the ceremony. UK critics still lean towards The Aviator for best film, yet they anticipate a fierce competition for the best director award between Eastwood and Martin Scorsese. Scorsese has yet to secure the best director accolade, despite four prior nominations for films such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Gangs of New York. Eastwood has previously won best director for Unforgiven in 1993. Most analysts predict that Jamie Foxx, nominated twice, will take home the best actor award for his role as singer Ray Charles, while Imelda Staunton, star of Vera Drake, is likely to be outshone in the best actress category by Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The UK's strongest hopes rest with Clive Owen, who has already won both the Golden Globe and the Bafta for his supporting performance in Closer. Comedian Chris Rock will host the event, which will be aired with a seven-second delay to enable censors to remove any inappropriate content. \"We have the bleep machine ready, but bleeps will be used as necessary,\" producer Gil Cates informed reporters. However, he expressed his disapproval of the increasing trend to censor live broadcasts on US television. He also downplayed concerns that Rock, known for his use of strong language in stand-up, might stir up controversy during the event. The 40-year-old comedian has already assured that he will refrain from swearing live on air during the show. \"Chris has a sense of humor, and everything he says is delivered humorously,\" Cates remarked. \"You need a movie star and a stand-up comic to navigate the ups and downs of the show.\" Security will be heightened, with police implementing a system to detect sarin nerve gas. \"We are pulling out all the stops,\" stated John Miller, chief of counterterrorism at the Los Angeles Police Department. The event is \"a symbol of American culture and has the potential to be a high-visibility target,\" he added. Meanwhile, organizers have set up a canopy over the red carpet due to a recent spell of heavy rain in Los Angeles. Cates mentioned that the covers would be taken down if the threat of rain diminished. Additionally, details have surfaced regarding this year's gift bags, which are distributed to nominees and presenters during the event. This year's bags will feature a gift certificate for a luxury beach resort, a pair of mink eyelashes, and a kitchen set complete with a year's supply of tea and coffee. The ceremony will be broadcast by the ABC network starting at 1700 local time (0100 GMT), and on Sky Movies in the UK from 0130 GMT."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nHollywood is preparing for the biggest night in the film world's calendar, the 77th Academy Awards, on Sunday.\nA host of stars are expected to grace the red carpet outside Los Angeles' Kodak Theatre, including Johnny Depp, Cate Blanchett and Leonardo DiCaprio.

[{"role": "user", "content": " We investigate how the band structure of electrodes influences transport in single-molecule junctions by measuring the conductance of pyridine-based compounds with Ag and Ni electrodes. Our research employs the scanning tunneling microscope-based break-junction technique and is corroborated by extensive density functional theory calculations. Both our observations and measurements indicate that the coupling of the primary transport orbital to the metal is less pronounced in Au-based junctions compared to Ag-based ones. We attribute this variation to quantum effects, which lead to a higher density of d-states at the Fermi energy for Au in contrast to Ag. Additionally, we demonstrate that the positioning of the conducting orbital in relation to the Fermi level does not align with the work function differences among the three metals and varies between conjugated and saturated structures. Thus, we conclude that the specifics of molecular level alignment and electronic coupling in metal-organic interfaces do not adhere to straightforward principles, but rather arise from intricate local interactions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nWe study the effect of electrode band structure on transport through\nsingle-molecule junctions by determining the conductance of pyridine-based\ncompounds using Ag and Ni electrodes.

[{"role": "user", "content": " We examine the lexicographically smallest infinite \\( a/b \\)-power-free word over the alphabet of non-negative integers.

To achieve this, we create an automated procedure for proving \\( a/b \\)-power-freeness for morphisms of a specific form, applicable to both explicit and symbolic rational numbers \\( a/b \\). Finally, we establish a connection to words over a finite alphabet.

Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in medical image processing. Researchers have employed various mathematical techniques, including statistical modeling, voxel-based methods, and machine learning approaches. This paper presents a semi-automatic method for liver segmentation from two-dimensional CAT scans, categorizing pixels into three distinct labels: healthy tissue, veins, and tumors. Initially, a novel approach is introduced to create a feature vector for each pixel, incorporating 59 intensity values from a series of time-series data. Additionally, a simplified edge cost is incorporated into the energy function. To optimize the graph cut process, the data and edges are normalized, eliminating the need to calculate the scaling parameter lambda. As an alternative to the traditional training process, tissue means are calculated based on a sample of regions identified by expert radiologists. The proposed method offers the advantage of being relatively straightforward to implement. It has been evaluated against a gold standard on a dataset of 10 tumors, yielding an average Dice coefficient of 0.77, an average overlap error of 37%, and an average processing time of 1.25 minutes per slice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDoctors still find it a time-consuming task to detect the tumours in medical images. There are many errors in this process, and that is why in the last decade, medical image processing has made great strides in development. A variety of mathematical methods, such as statistical modelling, voxel-based methods, and machine learning methods, have been used. This paper describes a method of semi-automatic liver segmentation from two-dimensional CAT images into three labels, namely, healthy, venous and tumour. First, we introduce a new way of constructing a feature vector for each pixel consisting of 59 intensities of a series of time series and we introduce a new simplified edge cost in the energy function. We normalize the data and the edges in the energy function to optimize the graph cut without having to calculate the scaling parameter lambda. As a substitute for the training process, tissue means are calculated on a sample of regions marked out by expert radiologists. The proposed method has the advantage of being relatively easy to implement. It has been evaluated against the ground truth on a CAT dataset of 10 tumours and the average Dice coefficient is 0.77, and the average overlap error is 37%, and the average processing time is 1.25 minutes per slice."}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nAlthough Lisaar is the daughter of the most beautiful queen and the most handsome king in all the land, she is a lonely child whose only true companion is her dog, Ash. She is mostly ignored during her childhood due to the fact that her parents were the two most splendid people in all seven kingdoms. Lisaar's mother falls ill and starts to lose her beauty. This causes her to lose her will to live, because she wants to be remembered as the most beautiful person, and nothing less. She sends for artists from all the kingdoms, and eventually one is chosen to paint a portrait of her as she was before her illness. He works nonstop, as if driven, for a fortnight until the painting is completed and shown to the queen. After looking at the painting, she forces the king to swear that he will only remember her if he can find a bride more beautiful than she, and after he acquiesces, she dies. This seemingly impossible condition is, however, insurable: as Lisaar matures, she becomes not just very like her mother, but more beautiful than her parents. The king becomes obsessed with his daughter, and insists that he will marry her. Lisaar refuses him and locks herself in a room. Eventually the king finds a way into the room and rapes Lisaar and almost kills Ash. Lisaar and Ash escape from the king and find their way to a cabin in the mountains. Lisaar, impregnated by her father the king, miscarries and nearly dies. Lisaar is saved by a moon goddess, who gives her a white deerskin dress (referenced in the title) and alters both Lisaar and Ash so that they are unrecognizable; Lisaar's hair changes from black to white, and Ash grows a coat similar to that of a borzoi. As another gift, the goddess gives Lisaar time to heal and makes her forget what happened to her. Lisaar travels to a different kingdom and offers to work for the king. The prince, Osin, assigns her to raise a litter of puppies whose mother had died. The goddess's alterations, however, were more than physical. Lisaar, now identified as Deerskin, discovers that she has supernatural powers, including the ability to find lost children and objects. She falls in love with Osin and he with her, but still burdened by her past, she flees when Osin proposes to her at a ball and returns to the cabin in the mountains with Ash and the puppies. After spending the winter recovering, Deerskin feels compelled to return to Osin's city, following an urgent call. As she nears the city, she hears about a wedding and assumes it is Osin's. She realizes to her horror that the king, her father, is going to marry Osin's younger sister. Deerskin reveals her true identity as the bridegroom's daughter and calls her father to account for his actions, using the goddess's powers to punish him for his crimes. Confronting her father finally frees Lisaar to accept Osin's love. The story ends with Lisaar tentatively coming back to Osin's arms, offering to give their relationship a chance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " Quantitative image analysis frequently relies on precise classification of digitized regions through a segmentation process. However, microscope artifacts, such as the partial volume effect and noise from photographic plates, lead to variations in the intensity of the digitized values of the constituent classes, resulting in overlaps between the intensities of different classes. This overlap creates ambiguity in the digitized intensity distributions, making thresholding methods ineffective due to the unclear overlapping areas. The complexity of this ambiguity increases when more than two constituents are present, as seen in unsaturated granular media. Therefore, in such instances, a series of steps is required: initially, the ambiguous transition areas between classes are identified and removed, allowing for the global thresholding of the one-class regions; next, the transition areas are classified using a distance function; finally, both segregations are merged to create a classified image. This process incorporates three techniques for identifying transitional areas, and we have demonstrated that these techniques can effectively distinguish ambiguous transitional areas from the one-class regions with commendable accuracy across numerous digitized images. For typical noise levels in the images, the misclassification errors and area discrepancies between each class of the synthetic images and the resulting classified images ranged from 0.69-1.48 and 0.01\u20130.74 %, respectively, indicating that the segregation accuracy is quite satisfactory.

The company is now considering a smaller \"peaking\" facility, which would use no water for generation and operate only during times of peak electricity use and emergencies to help ensure the reliability of the region's electricity supply.\n\nOriginally, the plan was for an 827-MW combined cycle facility fueled by natural gas. However, the alternative plant is a 510-MW peaking unit also powered by natural gas. Analysis suggests that Sithe Energies' original plans for the Ramapo plant have been thwarted by concerns among local residents who opposed certain aspects of the plant.\n\nRamapo is located 30 miles north of New York City, and the concerns of local residents centered on the fact that the original plant was planned to run all the time to meet demand, using local water resources for cooling purposes. In response to the concerns of residents, Sithe is modifying its plans for the plant and reducing its planned output.\n\nUnfortunately, Sithe plans to move forward with a smaller peaking unit at a time when it has become increasingly clear that the state of New York has serious power supply concerns. For background, it is worth noting that Exelon Corp. owns nearly half of Sithe Energies, and the remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe is owned by Vivendi (34 percent), Marubeni Corp. (15 percent), and Sithe Management (1 percent).\n\nJim McGowan, Sithe senior vice president for development, referenced the role that public opposition played when he spoke about the new plans for a peaking unit in the area. \"Sithe has a strong history of working closely with local communities and inviting their input to ensure their major issues are addressed,\" McGowan said. \"We've listened carefully to [residents'] concerns and are addressing them by considering a facility that is clean, less visible, and uses no water for generation.\"\n\nMcGowan further noted that the new peaking plant will only operate a limited number of hours annually while fulfilling the region's growing need for electricity during times of peak consumer demand.\n\nAs an independent power producer, Sithe Energies owns power plants across the United States and internationally. The company has a generation presence in states such as California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In New York, Sithe Energies owns four rather small plants and one large plant that generate approximately 1,329 MW.\n\nIn addition to the proposed peaking plant in Ramapo, Sithe Energies also has proposed Heritage Station, an 800 MW power plant located near Lake Ontario. A full siting review in New York normally takes a year to complete. However, projects under 80 MW are not required to go through the extensive environmental impact statement, which generally involves a detailed and time-consuming examination of alternatives.\n\nThe state of New York has not brought a new plant online since 1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost seven years since a 1,000 MW unit in Oswego, New York, marked the last plant to open upstate. Further, New York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years.

Consequently, 80 percent of the power that the city consumes i=\ns=20\ngenerated by the city. New plants are being proposed because New York City=\n=20\nreportedly will be 300 MW short of its required 8,428-MW generating capacit=\ny=20\nneeds this summer. That projected shortfall is expected to increase by=20\nanother 200 MW by summer 2002. =20\nIncreased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N=\new=20\nYork City and New York State. Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from 199=\n5=20\nto 2000, or 2.5 times as fast as new generation capacity was added. This=20\nyear's demand is expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 percent above=20\nregulators' earlier forecasts. According to the FERC report, New York City'=\ns=20\nload should reach 10,535 MW this summer alone, requiring 8,428 MW of in-cit=\ny=20\ncapacity, along with imports, to meet demand and provide a reserve margin.=\n=20\nWith a current capacity of 8,132 MW, there is a potential 296 MW shortfall.=\n=20\nLong Island has a potential 131 MW shortfall to meet the required 4,653 MW =\nof=20\npower. =20\nThe report confirms earlier projections by FERC Chairman Curt HSbert and=20\nothers that unless New York gets additional generation capacity online with=\nin=20\nthe next few months, the state could suffer some of California's problems.=\n=20\nHowever, despite the need for additional power generation in the state, the=\n=20\nintense public scrutiny of Sithe's plant in Ramapo echoes similar protests=\n=20\nfrom environmental groups and politicians for new generation plants=20\nthroughout the state. For instance, the New York Power Authority's (NYPA)=\n=20\nplan to install ten 44-MW combustion turbines by June was met with oppositi=\non=20\nfrom environmental groups like the New York Public Interest Research Group=\n=20\n(NYIRG), which has sued the NYPA, charging that it circumvented the=20\nenvironmental review process for siting new plants. In addition, FERC's=20\nreport included data from the New York ISO indicating that there were=20\napproximately 74 projects proposed to be built in New York State (as of=20\nNovember 2000). The report indicated that only one of these projects is=20\nlikely to be built in the next three to four years.=20\nAlthough Sithe has modified its plans into a smaller peaking unit, McGowan=\n=20\nhas reiterated that New York should not fall behind in meeting its energy=\n=20\nrequirements. If it does, it will make the same mistakes for which Californ=\nia=20\nis now paying a tremendous price. Along the same lines, William Muesler, CE=\nO=20\nof the New York ISO, recently said that to avoid a replication of=20\nCalifornia's market meltdown, New York must move quickly to build more powe=\nr=20\nplants. Muesler cited that 8,600 MW of new power plant capacity, 25 percent=\n=20\nmore than is currently available, must be constructed in New York by 2005 o=\nr=20\nshortages will become likely, pushing up prices and increasing the odds of=\n=20\nrolling blackouts. =20\nHowever, despite these clear warnings about the need for new power plants,=\n=20\n\"not in my back yard\" has been a common response in New York. Even New=20\nJersey's acting Governor Donald T. DiFrancesco has joined the ranks of thos=\ne=20\nopposing new power plants in the region. DiFrancesco reportedly told a=20\nmeeting of about a dozen North Jersey mayors who oppose new power plants th=\nat=20\nhe has created a task force to help opponents of various power plant projec=\nts=20\nin New York and New Jersey. Included in the task force are members of=20\nDiFrancesco's own staff, the state Department of Environmental Protection a=\nnd=20\nthe Attorney General's Office. Moreover, although California offers a clear=\n=20\npicture of the ramifications that can result from not establishing adequate=\n=20\nsupply, New York appears to be heading down a similar path. Although=20\nCalifornia and New York have different restructuring models, one market=20\nfactor is the same in both states: supply that cannot meet demand. We know=\n=20\nthe toll that this inequity has had on California. Is it only a matter of=\n=20\ntime before New York suffers the same consequences?=20\nAn archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at\nwww.ConsultRCI.com\nReach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day.

[{"role": "user", "content": "  \n6 quarts of water  \n3 tablespoons coarse salt  \n3 to 4 bunches (3 to 4 pounds) white asparagus, peeled and with tough ends of stalks trimmed by 1 inch  \nHollandaise Sauce (recipe follows)  \n2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter  \n6 large egg yolks  \n1/3 cup dry white wine  \n2 tablespoons water  \n2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  \nCoarse salt  \nCayenne pepper (optional)  \n(makes 3 cups)  \nBring the water to a boil in a large stockpot, then add the salt. Place the asparagus spears in the boiling water; cook just until tender, about 5 minutes. Carefully transfer to a colander to drain, taking care not to damage the tips. Pat dry with paper towels, and arrange on a large serving platter. Serve warm with hollandaise sauce.  \nTo clarify the butter: Slowly melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, skimming off any surface foam. Pour the clear layer of butter into a large glass measuring cup, leaving behind the milky residue, which can be discarded. Allow the butter to cool until it is lukewarm. Meanwhile, place the egg yolks and wine in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk vigorously until the mixture is very pale and the whisk leaves a trail, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat; continue whisking until the mixture is the same temperature as the butter, about 30 seconds. While whisking constantly, add the butter to the egg mixture, one drop at a time at first, gradually increasing to a steady stream. Once fully incorporated, stir in the water and lemon juice, and season with salt and cayenne pepper, if desired. Serve immediately, or keep warm over a pan of simmering water removed from heat."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n6\u200b \u200bq\u200bu\u200ba\u200br\u200bt\u200bs\u200b

[{"role": "user", "content": " Advanced image segmentation techniques typically involve at least two sequential and separate processes: a boundary detection phase that utilizes local image data to identify locations as boundaries between different objects, followed by a pixel grouping phase, such as watershed or connected components, that aggregates pixels into segments. Previous research has explored various complexities and methodologies in these two phases, including the use of multi-layer neural networks for boundary prediction and the application of global optimizations during pixel clustering. We introduce a cohesive and end-to-end trainable machine learning method, known as flood-filling networks, where a recurrent 3D convolutional network directly generates distinct segments from a raw image. This method effectively segments images containing an unknown and varying number of objects, as well as objects of highly diverse sizes. We showcase this technique on a demanding 3D image segmentation challenge, specifically connectomic reconstruction from volume electron microscopy data, where flood-filling neural networks significantly enhance accuracy compared to other leading methods. This proposed technique can streamline intricate multi-step segmentation processes into a single neural network that is trained end-to-end."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nState-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms generally consist of at least\ntwo successive and distinct computations: a boundary detection process that\nuses local image information to classify image locations as boundaries between\nobjects, followed by a pixel grouping step such as watershed or connected\ncomponents that clusters pixels into segments.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Black July (Kaluu Juliya) was an anti-Tamil pogrom that took place in Sri Lanka in July 1983. The violence was premeditated and was ultimately triggered by a deadly ambush on 23 July 1983, which resulted in the deaths of 13 Sri Lanka Army soldiers, carried out by the Tamil militant group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Although initially orchestrated by members of the ruling UNP, the pogrom quickly escalated into widespread violence with significant public involvement. On the night of 24 July 1983, anti-Tamil riots erupted in the capital city of Colombo and subsequently spread to other regions of the country. Over the course of seven days, predominantly Sinhalese mobs attacked, burned, looted, and killed Tamil civilians. Estimates of the death toll ranged from 400 to 3,000, and approximately 150,000 people were displaced. Around 8,000 homes and 5,000 shops were destroyed. The economic impact of the riots was estimated to be $300 million. The NGO International Commission of Jurists characterized the pogrom as a genocide in a report published in December 1983."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nSir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenal's Thierry Henry for a reckless incident involving Gabriel Heinze. Ferguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during United's contentious win. He compared the tackle to Ruud van Nistelrooy's foul on Ashley Cole, for which he received a three-game ban. \"We shall present it to the FA and see what they do,\" he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents, but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline. Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinze's head.\n\nThe striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side's behavior. \"Eden produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker,\" he said. \"There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. \"I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. \"We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don't they?\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nS\u200bi\u200br\u200b

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nWinnie Barringer is struggling to cope with the loss of her best friend Iggie, whose family has relocated to Japan. Her curiosity is piqued when she notices a new family, the Garbers, moving into Iggie's old house. The fact that the Garbers are a black family fascinates Winnie, and she soon forms a bond with the three kids. However, not everyone in the community is welcoming of the Garbers. Winnie's neighbour, Mrs. Landon, is determined to have them leave, and she organises a petition to pressure the family into moving. Despite her parents' apparent indifference, Winnie is deeply disturbed by their lack of support. Mrs. Landon's actions escalate when she posts a harassing sign on the Garbers' lawn, prompting Winnie to create a questionnaire to gauge the community's attitudes towards black people. The Garber kids accuse Winnie of befriending them solely because she thinks it's trendy, causing a rift between them. The Garber parents are seriously considering a move, which would be devastating for Winnie. Mrs. Landon's visit to Winnie's parents is a turning point, as she not only complains about Winnie's questionnaire but also announces her own plans to leave the area. In the ensuing argument, Winnie confronts Mrs. Landon about her racist views. The next morning, Winnie discovers that her parents are indeed considering a move, which prompts her to contemplate a drastic solution: becoming a stowaway to join Iggie in Japan. However, Winnie eventually makes amends with the Garbers, and it's revealed that neither they nor her parents have ultimately decided to leave."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nWinnie Barringer misses her best friend Iggie, whose family has moved to Japan.

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nWe investigated the optical interaction between a rotating nanosphere and an orbital angular momentum-carrying optical cavity mode. Specifically, we considered a dielectric nanosphere rotating uniformly inside a ring-shaped optical potential inside a Fabry-Perot resonator. The motion of the particle was probed by a weak angular lattice, created by introducing two additional degenerate Laguerre-Gaussian cavity modes carrying equal and opposite orbital angular momentum. We demonstrated that the rotation frequency of the nanosphere is imprinted on the probe optical mode, via the Doppler shift, and thus may be sensed experimentally using homodyne detection. We analytically showed that the effect of the optical probe on the particle rotation vanishes in the regime of linear response, resulting in an accurate frequency measurement. We also numerically characterized the degradation of the measurement accuracy when the system is driven in the nonlinear regime. Our results are relevant to rotational Doppler velocimetry and to studies of rotational Brownian motion in a periodic lattice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n\u200b

The Dow Industrials fell 21.80 points to 10,935.17, and the S&P 500 slipped 3.10 points to 1,263.51. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.98 points to 2,173.55.\n\nMarket Commentary:\n\nThe stock indexes were lower on Monday, with subdued trading ahead of this week's economic news. Despite losses, gains in chip stocks limited overall declines. The Dow closed near mid-range, with support from drug and cyclical stocks, as well as gains in Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak, and IBM. Momentum indicators remain bullish, signaling a possible test of February's high.\n\nInterest Rates:\n\nJune bonds closed lower, extending last Friday's loss. Expectations are high that the Fed will cut interest rates by 50 basis points at its May 15th FOMC meeting. Momentum indicators remain bullish, suggesting sideways to higher prices near-term.\n\nEnergy Markets:\n\nEnergy markets closed lower due to profit taking triggered by President Bush's comments on high retail energy prices. June crude oil turned short-term momentum indicators neutral to bearish, while June heating oil remains within last week's trading range. June unleaded gas posted a key reversal down, and June Henry Hub natural gas plunged below key support.\n\nCurrencies:\n\nThe June Dollar closed higher, above April's uptrend line. The June Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower, extending last week's narrow trading ranges. The June Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower, confirming last Friday's key reversal down and trendline breakout.\n\nPrecious Metals:\n\nJune gold closed steady, remaining above April's uptrend line but below the long-term downtrend line. Momentum indicators are overbought, warning traders that June gold is at an important crossroads. July silver posted an inside day with a lower close, while July copper posted an inside day with a higher close.\n\nGrains:\n\nJuly corn posted a key reversal down, weighed down by forecasts for increased precip across the dry eastern Corn Belt and a quiet export market. July wheat closed sharply lower, following widespread rains across the Plains. July soybeans closed lower due to increased chances for rain across the eastern Soybean Belt.\n\nLIVESTOCK:\n\nJune hogs posted a potential downside reversal but held above the 2000-01 uptrend line. June cattle closed higher, extending last Friday's late-session short covering bounce. Signs of rising boxed-beef prices triggered today's rally.\n\nFood & Fiber:\n\nJuly coffee resumed this spring's short covering rally, while July cocoa closed modestly higher in narrow trading. July sugar closed lower due to profit taking, hinting that the market might have priced in all of the bullish export news from Asia.\n\nTop News:\n\nJapan Stocks Review: Up 0.8%, little reaction to PM's speech\nUS Equities Review: Lower in quiet, aimless trade\nUK Stocks Review: FTSE-100 bounces back despite US data hiccup\n\nExtreme Futures:\n\nBDU1 Oriented Strand Board Sep 2001 224.60 10.00 +4.66\nKCN1 Coffee 'C' Jul 2001 68.75 2.70 +4.08\nLBF2 Random Length Lumber Jan 2002 309.50 9.50 +3.17\nDBV1 Butter Oct 2001 190.000 5.000 +2.70\nCCK1 Cocoa May 2001 1034 22 +2.17\n\nExtreme Stocks:\n\nMGAMW MULTIMEDIA GAMES WRRT'A' 6.10 1.80 +41.38\nLNOP LANOPTICS LTD 12.05 3.40 +39.31\nBWE BANCWEST CORP 34.31 9.35 +37.43\nPXCM PROXICOM INC 7.44 1.78 +31.45\nPYR PYR ENERGY CORP 6.73 1.48 +28.19\n\nThank you for subscribing to the Extreme Markets Daily Digest from INO.com.

Both indexes\nare at important crossroads as they are challenging April's highs.\nMultiple closes above these resistance levels are needed to extend\nthis spring's rallies. At the same time, momentum indicators are\noverbought warning bulls to use caution as short-term tops might be\nin or near.\nThe Dow closed lower on Monday but near mid-range. Light support came\nfrom drug and cyclical stocks. Gains in Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak\nand IBM also provided support for the Dow. Momentum indicators remain\nbullish signaling that a test of February's high crossing at\n11,035.10 is still possible this month.\nINTEREST RATES June bonds closed lower on Monday as they extended\nlast Friday's loss. Expectations are running at 80-90% that the Fed\nwill cut interest rates by another 50-basis-points at its May 15th\nFOMC meeting following last week's larger-than-expected unemployment\nreport. Today's setback was no big surprise giving last Friday's poor\nclose. Nevertheless, last week's breakout above this spring's\ndowntrend line signals that a short-term bottom and trend change has\ntaken place. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that\nsideways to higher prices near-term are possible. If June resumes\nlast week's rally the 50% retracement level crossing at 103-20 is a\npotential target.\nThe CRB INDEX closed lower on Monday due to weakness in grains,\nbellies and energies. Today's decline turned a number of momentum\nindicators including stochastics bearish warning traders that last\nweek's high might have marked a double top with April's high. Closes\nbelow 212.64 would open the door for a larger- degree decline during\nMay.\nENERGY MARKETS closed lower on Monday due to profit taking that was\ntriggered by comments made by President Bush who indicated his\nconcerns over high retail energy prices. Additional pressure came\nfrom expectations that this week's API data will once again show\nstocks rose last week. Retail gasoline prices are running at record\nhighs, eclipsing last June's levels amid a series of disruptions at\nrefineries that feed the gas-hungry U.S. market.\nJune crude oil closed lower on Monday and in doing so turned a number\nof short-term momentum indicators neutral to bearish. Closes below\nlast week's low crossing at 27.37 would confirm that the short-term\ntrend has turned down. I would not be surprised to see a steady to\nhigher close on Tuesday due to light short covering. Resistance\nbegins at 29.40 then February's high crossing at 30.13.\nJune heating oil closed sharply lower on Monday but remains within\nlast week's trading range. Closes above 77.80 or below 73.10 are\nneeded to confirm a breakout of a two-week trading range and clear up\nnear-term direction in the market. Momentum indicators are neutral to\nbearish hinting that sideways to lower prices near-term are possible.\nJune unleaded gas posted a key reversal down on Monday due to profit\ntaking after falling short of testing weekly resistance crossing at\n109.60. Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's\nbearish reversal pattern. However, it will take closes below\ntrendline support crossing near 103-25 before a top and trend change\ncan be confirmed. The weekly ADX (a trend-following indicator)\nremains in a bullish trend mode signaling that we could see\nadditional gains this spring.\nJune Henry Hub natural gas plunged below key weekly support crossing\nat 4.38 on Monday due to expectations that this week's AGA inventory\ndata will continue to show natural gas supplies building. Today's\nplunge below key support crossing at 4.38 has opened the door for\nadditional weakness and a possible test of the 75% retracement level\nof the 1999/2000 rally crossing at 3.625 later this spring. The\nrising ADX signals that additional weakness during May is possible.\nCURRENCIES The June Dollar closed higher on Monday and above April's\nuptrend line crossing near 115.27. Additional gains on Tuesday would\nincrease the odds that last week's correction has come to an end.\nMomentum indicators are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to\nhigher prices near-term are possible.\nThe June Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on Monday as they\nextended last week's narrow trading ranges. Closes above April's high\nor low are needed to clear up near-term direction in both markets.\nMomentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower\nprices near-term are possible.\nThe June Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower and below April's\nuptrend line on Monday thereby confirming last Friday's key reversal\ndown and trendline breakout. With this spring's rally stalling out\nnear the 50% retracement level of this year's decline and Monday's\ntrendline breakout, the door is open for sideways to lower prices\nduring May. Momentum indicators have also turned bearish signaling\nthat additional weakness is possible. I would not be surprised to see\na lower opening on Tuesday but would not rule out a short covering\nbounce.\nThe June Japanese Yen closed higher due to a late- session rally as\nthe market continues to challenge the upper boundary of this spring's\ntrading range crossing at .8327. Multiple closes above this\nresistance level are needed to confirm a breakout and trend change.\nMomentum indicators are bullish hinting that additional gains are\npossible.\nPRECIOUS METALS June gold closed steady on Monday as it remains above\nApril's uptrend line but below the long-term downtrend line crossing\nnear 269. Momentum indicators have become overbought warning traders\nthat June gold is at an important crossroads. Closes above or below\nthe aforementioned support/resistance levels are needed to clear up\nnear-term direction in the market.\nJuly silver posted an inside day with a lower close as the market\nfell short of testing the lower boundary of this spring's trading\nrange crossing at 4.31. Closes below 4.31 are needed to confirm a\ntrading range breakout and trend change. Momentum indicators are\nbearish but nearing their respective overbought zones hinting that\nthis spring's trading range may remain intact for the time being.\nJuly copper posted an inside day with a higher close due to light\nshort covering as it consolidated some of last Thursday and Friday's\nlosses. Closes below last Friday's low crossing at 78.00 would turn a\nnumber of short-term momentum indicators bearish thereby increasing\nthe odds that a short-term top was posted last week.\nGRAINS July corn posted a key reversal down on Monday as forecasts\nfor increased precip across the dry eastern Corn Belt and a quiet\nexport market weighed on prices. Trading is likely to remain subdued\nahead of Thursday's supply/demand report. This afternoon's planting\nprogress report showed that 58% of the U.S. corn crop is planted\ncompared with 74% a year ago and 52% for the five-year average. This\nwill likely add to the selling pressure on Tuesday, as planting delay\nfears will have been reduced. July's inability to close above broken\nsupport crossing at 2.11 underscores the weak tone surrounding the\ncorn market at this point in time.\nJuly wheat closed sharply lower on Monday following widespread rains\nthat fell across portions of the Plains over the weekend. Today's\nbreakout below trendline support crossing near 2.71 fell short of\ntesting March's low of 2.65 1/2. Closes below this support level\nwould renew the long-term downtrend while setting the stage for a\npossible test of weekly support crossing at 2.50 later this summer. I\nwould not be surprised to see a steady to higher close on Tuesday due\nto short covering following today's late- session bounce. Today's\nplanting progress report showed that 35% of the spring wheat is\nplanted compared with the five-year average of 50%. The crop\nconditions report for winter wheat showed that 26% is rated poor to\nvery poor, 33% is fair and 41% is rated good to excellent.\nSOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed lower on Monday due to increased\nchances for rain across the eastern Soybean Belt this week. July\nsoybeans continue to hold above broken trendline resistance as they\nextended last week's trading range. However, upside potential appears\nlimited in the face of slowing export sales, burdensome carryout\nlevels and increased U.S. planted acreage this year. If the rally off\nthe late-April low resumes, this spring's high at 4.49 3/4 is July's\nnext target. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their\nrespective overbought zones hinting that a short-term top might be in\nor near.\nJuly soybean meal closed lower on Monday due to light profit taking\nand spillover selling from soybeans and wheat. Today's mid-range\nclose leaves the door open for sideways to higher trading on Tuesday\nas last week's rally opened the door for a possible test of March's\nhigh crossing at 160.50 later this spring. Momentum indicators are\nbullish but nearing their respective overbought zones warning bulls\nto use caution.\nLIVESTOCK June hogs posted a potential downside reversal on Monday\nbut held above the 2000-01 uptrend line crossing near 66.75. Multiple\ncloses below this support level would confirm a trendline breakout\nwhile opening the door for a larger-degree decline this spring.\nWeekly momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that\nadditional weakness near-term is possible.\nJune cattle closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday's\nlate-session short covering bounce. Signs of rising boxed-beef prices\ntriggered today's rally. However, gains were limited by expectations\nfor steady to $1.00 lower cash bids this week. Momentum indicators\nare oversold and diverging following last week's test of January's\nlow. I would not be surprised to see additional short covering during\nthe first half of this week.\nFOOD & FIBER July coffee resumed this spring's short covering rally\nas traders continue to build in a modest weather premium as winter\napproaches in Brazil. If this month's rally continues, March's high\nat 71.70 is July's next target. Momentum indicators remain bullish\nsignaling that additional short-term gains are possible this week.\nJuly cocoa closed modestly higher in narrow trading as it continues\nto consolidate above this spring's lows crossing at 955. Closes above\n1034 or below 955 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the\nmarket.\nJuly sugar closed lower on Monday due to profit taking hinting that\nthe market might have priced in all of the bullish export news from\nAsia at this point in time. Momentum indicators are very overbought\nand turning neutral to bearish hinting that a short-term top is in or\nnear. If the decline off last week's high continues, trendline\nsupport crossing near 885 is July's next target. Closes below this\nsupport level would confirm a short-term top has been posted. If the\nrally continues, this year's high crossing at 941 is July's next\ntarget.\nJuly cotton closed slightly higher on Monday as it consolidates near\nthe bottom of this spring's trading range. Trading is likely to\nremain subdued ahead of this week's supply/demand report. Favorable\nmoisture conditions across west Texas and the Delta along with\nburdensome carryout levels continues to limit gains in both old and\nnew-crop cotton.\nDaily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\nINO.com's end-of-day charting software for Futures, Futures\nOptions and Optionable Stocks. http://www.globalcharts.com\nSearch the INO Store - http://store.ino.com/\n_____________________________________________________________________\nT O P N E W S\n_____________________________________________________________________\nSTOCKS\nJapan Stocks Review: Up 0.8%, little reaction to PM's speech\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25255\nUS Equities Review: Lower in quiet, aimless trade\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25254\nUK Stocks Review: FTSE-100 bounces back despite US data hiccup\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25261\nFOREX\nUS FX Review: Dollar mixed; euro pressured by weak data\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25257\nAsia FX Review: Koizumi speech fails to set JPY direction\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25262\nEurope FX Review: Poor U.S. jobs data sends dollar reeling\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25256\nCREDIT\nUS Credit Review: Short end posts slim gains on rate cut hopes\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25253\nEurope Credit Review: US labor mkt weakness good news for bonds\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25258\nJapan Credit Review: Jun up but market lacks overall direction\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25260\nCOMMODITIES\nUS Futures Summary: Energy takes a dive; coffee jumps\n http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25259\nEXCHANGES\nCME Posts Record Open Interest On Second Busiest Day\n http://news.ino.com/press/?release=23558\n____________________________________________________________________________\nE X T R E M E F U T U R E S\n____________________________________________________________________________\nUpdated every 10 minutes around the clock.\nMore at http://quotes.ino.com/analysis/extremes/futures/\nWINNERS\nBDU1 Oriented Strand Board Sep 2001 224.60 10.00 +4.66\nKCN1 Coffee 'C' Jul 2001 68.75 2.70 +4.08\nLBF2 Random Length Lumber Jan 2002 309.50 9.50 +3.17\nDBV1 Butter Oct 2001 190.000 5.000 +2.70\nCCK1 Cocoa May 2001 1034 22 +2.17\nSEN1 Sugar #14 Domestic Jul 2001 21.34 0.20 +0.95\nNKH2 Nikkei 225 Stock Avg Mar 2002 14520 125 +0.87\nHUF2 New York Harbor Unleaded Gasoline Jan 20 0.7750 0.0063 +0.82\nHOH2 Heating Oil Mar 2002 7580 58 +0.77\nERY0 FTSE Eurotop 100 Cash 3286.3 21.8 +0.67\nLOSERS\nDJU1 Dow Jones Industrial Avg.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Steve Bechtel (born March 19, 1970) is a rock climber, coach, and author residing in Lander, Wyoming. He has played a significant role in advancing climbing in the area since the 1990s. Bechtel is regarded as a primary suspect in the unresolved disappearance of his first wife, Amy Wroe Bechtel. Biography Bechtel was born in Casper, Wyoming. As a teenager, he began rock climbing in central Wyoming, inspired by the sport's popularity in Europe at the time. He later described these experiences as \"great [opportunities] as a young person to see people at the cutting edge of the sport.\" His interest in Lander, Wyoming was sparked in the summer of 1990 when he learned about the limestone in the Black Hills, which was considered ideal for rock climbing. After two brief visits there that same year, Bechtel decided to relocate the following year. Aside from a short stint in the early 2000s when he lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, Bechtel has since permanently resided in Lander. He cited the Sinks Main Wall as the reason he chose to settle in the town."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nS\u200bt\u200be\u200bv\u200be\u200b

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nHonore Desmonde Sharer (July 12, 1920 \u2013 April 17, 2009) was a renowned American artist. Her work first gained widespread recognition in 1950 with the painting 'Tribute to the American Working People', a five-image polyptich conceived in the style of a Renaissance altarpiece, except that its central figure is a factory worker, not a saint. Flanking this central figure are smaller scenes of ordinary people - at a picnic, in a parlor, on a farm, and in a schoolroom. Painted meticulously in oil on composition board in a style reminiscent of the Flemish Masters, the finished work is over six feet long and three feet high, and took her five years to complete. It was the subject of a 2007 retrospective at the Smithsonian Institution and is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Sharer first received public notice when her work 'Workers and Paintings' (1943) was included in the legendary 1946 'Fourteen Americans' show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, curated by Dorothy Canning Miller. This show featured a selection of up-and-coming artists, including Robert Motherwell, Isamu Noguchi (sculpture), and Saul Steinberg. The 'Fourteen Americans' show at the Museum of Modern Art, while often thought to proclaim the arrival of abstract expressionism, did not do so unambiguously since it included artists like Sharer and George Tooker who are not modernists based on the litmus test of abstraction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n\u0397\u043en\u043er\u00e9 D\u0435sm\u043end Sh\u0430rr\u0435r (Jul\u0443 12, 1920 \u2013 \u0391\u0440r\u0456l 17, 2009) w\u0430s \u0430n \u0391m\u0435r\u0456\u0441\u0430n \u0430rt\u0456st.

Recent advancements in gaze estimation have shown that utilizing information from the entire face region can enhance performance. Building on this concept, we introduce an appearance-based approach that, unlike traditional methods in computer vision, relies solely on the complete face image as input. Our technique processes the face image through a convolutional neural network, applying spatial weights to the feature maps to selectively suppress or amplify information in various facial areas. Through comprehensive testing, we demonstrate that our full-face approach significantly surpasses existing methods for both 2D and 3D gaze estimation, achieving enhancements of up to 14.3% on MPIIGaze and 27.7% on EYEDIAP for person-independent 3D gaze estimation.

Some government departments have reportedly doubled the amount of documents being destroyed in anticipation of the Freedom of Information Act taking effect on January 1. The departments of defence, environment, and trade, which have all ramped up file destruction, claim they are adhering to regulations regarding public records. However, the Tories are urging the information commissioner to conduct an investigation. The Freedom of Information Act will, for the first time, allow the public access to government records that have been kept confidential for 30 years. BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy noted that the possibility of outsiders examining the inner workings of Whitehall seems to be unsettling the officials. \n\nLiberal Democrat Alan Beith, who chairs the select committee overseeing the Department of Constitutional Affairs, stated that if the allegations are accurate, Whitehall is \"acting entirely against the spirit of the new Act.\" He emphasized that both the information commissioner and the select committee must closely monitor this situation. Fellow Lib Dem Norman Baker remarked that this incident presents an \"unflattering picture of the inner workings of government.\" He added, \"It is evident that the government's initial enthusiasm for open governance has shifted to self-serving cynicism.\" Dr. Julian Lewis, the Conservative spokesperson for the Cabinet Office, reported that he had noticed a significant increase in shredding based on a series of parliamentary responses.\n\nLast year, the Department of Work and Pensions destroyed nearly 37,000 files, an increase of 22,000 compared to four years ago when the Act was enacted.

Dr. Lewis has called for an investigation by information commissioner Richard Thomas.

He expressed that he \"totally condemned\" the practice of deleting emails to avoid their disclosure under the freedom of information laws set to take effect on January 1.\n\nGovernment guidance states that emails should only be deleted if they have \"no current purpose,\" according to Mr. Thomas. A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office asserted that the action was not related to the new laws or \"the destruction of important records.\" The Freedom of Information Act will apply to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland starting next year, with similar measures being introduced simultaneously in Scotland.

The survey conducted by the Sunday Times also revealed that 63 percent felt he had acted out of spite in his resignation, while 61 percent believed he was justified in doing so. The YouGov poll was conducted from December 16 to 18, surveying 1,981 voters. Blunkett stepped down as Home Secretary last Wednesday following an inquiry that uncovered an email indicating that the visa application for Mrs. Quinn\u2019s former nanny had been expedited. Sir Alan Budd\u2019s investigation also disclosed that Blunkett had provided misleading accounts of the situation. Nevertheless, the majority of respondents in the Sunday Times poll, 18 percent, felt he should be allowed to return to the Cabinet immediately upon regaining his position. A quarter of those surveyed believed he should be reinstated within a year or two. Only 14 percent thought Mrs. Quinn should be allowed back into the Cabinet. A total of 75 percent supported Blunkett's decision to pursue legal action for the right to see his son with Mrs. Quinn, whom he claims is his child. Fifty-three percent of respondents expressed sympathy for Blunkett, while 40 percent did not. Additionally, 53 percent believed Blunkett had been an effective Home Secretary, compared to 17 percent who disagreed. Only 32 percent rated Tony Blair as a good Prime Minister, while 38 percent did not. In contrast, a majority of 52 percent felt Chancellor Gordon Brown had performed well, while 16 percent disagreed. A separate poll for the Independent on Sunday indicated that support for all political parties had remained relatively stable since the Blunkett incident, with Labour leading the Conservatives 39 percent to 33 percent, and the Liberal Democrats at 19 percent. The poll, conducted by Communicate Research, included 401 interviews before Blunkett's resignation and 601 afterward. Eighty-two percent believed it was commendable that Blunkett sought to take responsibility for the child, but only 42 percent thought it was appropriate for him to take the issue to court, while 45 percent disagreed.

Background\n On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in\n Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000\n (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-\n based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through\n the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication\n among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on\n EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on\n 1\n EnronOnline. This amendment does not supplant the existing\n provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which\n allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the\n Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there\n are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to\n its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower\n than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous\n offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,\n established index. Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their\n respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make\n 1\n The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,\n an Enron Corp. subsidiary. EnronOnline is a free, Internet-\n based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view\n real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly\n online. EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather\n EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in\n buying from and selling power to third parties.\n Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-\n and ER01-2103-000\n inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions\n different than those in place but that, they state, will still\n prevent affiliate abuse. Applicants state that the Commission's\n requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in\n electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's\n requirement that \"PGE post on its website notice of a potential\n purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the\n transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since\n EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not\n provide for a waiting period before consummating the\n 2\n transaction.\" According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the\n ability to buy or sell power \"from perhaps the largest marketer\n 3\n in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers.\"\n II. Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests\n Notices of the filings were published in the Federal\n Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),\n and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with\n motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before\n June 12, 2001. None was filed.\n III. Discussion\n The Commission allows power marketers and their public\n utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates\n when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate\n abuse. As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can\n occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers\n sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at\n above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers\n (such as a power marketer affiliate). One way in which the\n Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization\n by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate\n 4\n sales at an established, relevant market price or index.\n Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are\n transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various\n conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent\n 5\n affiliate abuse.\n 2\n EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.\n 3\n EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.\n 4\n See, e.g., DPL Energy, Inc. 90 FERC 61,200 (2000);\n accord, First Energy Trading Services, Inc., 88 FERC 61,067 at\n 61,156 (1999).\n 5\n E.g., GPU Advanced Resources, Inc., 81 FERC 61,335 at\n (continued...)\n Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3-\n and ER01-2103-000\n Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to\n use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the\n following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient\n protection against affiliate abuse. PGE, when buying from EPMI\n using EnronOnline, will be required to \"take the transaction\n price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular\n 6\n location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment.\" In\n 7\n addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders or\n engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity\n of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction\n being finalized. Applicants also propose to amend their\n respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication\n regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.\n Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate\n abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at\n 5\n (...continued)\n 62,539 (1997) (GPU); Detroit Edison Company, 80 FERC 61,348 at\n 62,197-98 (1997) (Detroit Edison). In GPU, the Commission\n allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional\n public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate\n the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard\n supplier agreements. Accord, First Energy Trading & Power\n Marketing, Inc., 84 FERC 61,214 at 62,037-38, reh'g denied, 85\n FERC 61,311 (1998). Detroit Edison provided that a traditional\n public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer\n only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-\n affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its\n electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same\n rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the\n affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin\n board. Accord, Jersey Central Power & Light Co., 82 FERC\n 61,023 at 61,071 (1998); Commonwealth Edison Co., 85 FERC\n 61,288 at 62,176-77 (1998).\n 6\n EPMI Application at 4; PGE Application at 5.\n 7\n In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would\n know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or\n lower than that currently available. Applications at 3. While\n Applicants do not define \"Limit Order,\" the common understanding\n is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to\n transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in\n the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the\n order only if certain conditions are met. Generally, a limit\n order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when\n the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which\n case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.\n Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-\n and ER01-2103-000\n the posted price (a price that is offered to all market\n participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI\n knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is\n finalized. Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be\n unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,\n but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.\n Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by\n computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of\n PGE. In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted\n electronically and is available to all market participants,\n Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to\n transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and\n conditions that are available to PGE.\n Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed\n restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the\n Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,\n protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its\n 8\n transactions with its affiliate EPMI). The thrust of\n Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse\n concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for\n selling power between affiliates. We disagree. While perhaps\n faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an\n Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and\n speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's\n affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied. There is, for\n example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline\n 9\n represent prevailing market prices.\n Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI\n via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no\n affiliate abuse. We are not certain, however, that the posted\n price necessarily represents the market price. While, on the\n surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an\n auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result\n of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,\n for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to\n sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI\n 10\n is willing to buy at. For other transactions through media\n other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be\n 8\n See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases\n that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate\n power sales).\n 9\n See supra note 4 and accompanying text.\n 10\n All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a\n participant. For sales, EPMI is the seller. For purchases, EPMI\n is the buyer.\n Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-\n and ER01-2103-000\n 11\n willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.\n Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product\n prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be\n any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via\n EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-\n affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically\n trade those products to attain similar benefits.\n Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be\n transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now\n turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions\n established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.\n Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE\n through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed\n restrictions that would require PGE to\n simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate\n offered to the affiliate. The Commission requires that, with\n respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same\n offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its\n electronic bulletin board. But it is unclear whether PGE can or\n will make the same offer to non-affiliates.\n Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited\n from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from\n knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction. Again,\n this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-\n market prices.\n The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal\n that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline\n will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's\n expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for\n inter-affiliate power sales transactions. There is, for example,\n no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how\n unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would\n monitor inter-affiliate transactions.\n For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed\n amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their\n proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating\n appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.\n 11\n Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and\n sell at higher prices.\n Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -6-\n and ER01-2103-000\n The Commission orders:\n Applicants' proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected,\n without prejudice, as discussed in the body of this order.\n By the Commission.\n ( S E A L )\n David P.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nDomain adaptation (DA) has garnered significant interest due to its ability to adapt a model trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly labeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains. However, in practice, it is common that the source images are not available during the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical imaging, for instance, when the source and target images come from different clinical sites. We propose a novel formulation for adapting segmentation networks, which relaxes such a constraint. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy loss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a domain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be used, derived from anatomical information. Here, a class-ratio prior is learned via an auxiliary network and integrated in the form of a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in our overall loss function. We show the effectiveness of our prior-aware entropy minimization in adapting spine segmentation across different MRI modalities. Our method yields comparable results to several state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, even though it has access to less information, the source images being absent in the adaptation phase. Our straightforward adaptation strategy only uses one network, contrary to popular adversarial techniques, which cannot perform without the presence of the source images. Our framework can be readily used with various priors and segmentation problems."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nD\u200bo\u200bm\u200ba\u200bi\u200bn\u200b

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nAnna and Claire, two women, are at odds over Claire's new love interest. Meanwhile, Anna's Scottish maid, Catherine, is struggling with her employer's harsh verbal rebukes. As tensions rise, Anna, a mistress to a wealthy gentleman, tries to talk Claire out of her profession of love for another young woman. Claire, however, has already made plans with her young love to meet at Anna's house, hoping she will be able to persuade her new love to engage in a \"vile assignment.\" However, things go awry when the girl arrives and recognizes that an emerald necklace Anna is wearing belongs to her mother. The plot focuses on whether Anna and Claire will be able to find a way to hold onto both the girl and her wealthy but unfaitful father. The play is delivered through quick, witty Victorian-era dialogue, mixed with double entendres and verbal expressions, to explore the relationships between the two women and their maid. Through humor and nuance, the play explores the negotiation, conflict, compromise, and reconciliation that arise in their relationship."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nMark Mathabane was born into a poverty-stricken family in the town of Alexandra during the apartheid years. Throughout his childhood, he witnessed and suffered from hunger, violence, and racial stereotypes, which taught him to hate and fear whites. However, at his mother's insistence, Mark started school and learned to love it, eventually rising to the top of his class despite frequent punishments due to his family's late payments for school fees and inability to afford school supplies. He graduated from primary school with a scholarship that would cover his secondary education. Mark's grandmother became a gardener for a kind family, the Smiths, who introduced him to books and tennis by sending him books and even a tennis racket home with his grandmother. He learned English from these books and began to play tennis frequently, eventually befriending a black tennis player who trained him. Mark joined the high school tennis team and started playing in tournaments, unofficially sponsored by Wilfred Horn, owner of the Tennis Ranch. Although it was technically illegal for Mark to play there, the law was ignored, and he became comfortable with whites. Eventually, renowned tennis player Stan Smith took Mark under his wing when the two met at a tournament. Stan paid for Mark to compete in tournaments and talked to his coach at the University of Southern California about Mark attending college in the states. The coach wrote to colleges on Mark's behalf, and he earned a tennis scholarship to Limestone College, leaving for the U.S. in 1978."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n\u039c\u0430rk \u041c\u0430th\u0430b\u0430n\u0435 w\u0430s b\u043ern \u0456nt\u043e \u0430 \u0440\u043ev\u0435rt\u0443-str\u0456\u0441k\u0435n f\u0430m\u0456l\u0443 dur\u0456ng th\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0430rth\u0435\u0456d \u0443\u0435\u0430rs \u0456n th\u0435 t\u043ewnsh\u0456\u0440 \u043ef \u0391l\u0435\u0445\u0430ndr\u0430. \u03a4hr\u043eugh\u043eut \u0441h\u0456ldh\u043e\u043ed, h\u0435 w\u0456tn\u0435ss\u0435s \u0430nd suff\u0435rs fr\u043em hung\u0435r, v\u0456\u043el\u0435n\u0441\u0435, \u0430nd r\u0430\u0441\u0456\u0430l st\u0435r\u0435\u043et\u0443\u0440\u0435s, l\u0435\u0430rn\u0456ng t\u043e h\u0430t\u0435 \u0430nd f\u0435\u0430r wh\u0456t\u0435s. \u0410t h\u0456s m\u043eth\u0435r\u2019s \u0456ns\u0456st\u0435n\u0441\u0435, \u041c\u0430th\u0430b\u0430n\u0435 st\u0430rts s\u0441h\u043e\u043el \u0430nd l\u0435\u0430rns t\u043e l\u043ev\u0435 \u0456t, r\u0456s\u0456ng t\u043e th\u0435 t\u043e\u0440 \u043ef h\u0456s \u0441l\u0430ss \u0456n s\u0440\u0456t\u0435 \u043ef fr\u0435qu\u0435nt \u0440un\u0456shm\u0435nts du\u0435 t\u043e h\u0456s f\u0430m\u0456l\u0443\u2019s l\u0430t\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0443m\u0435nts f\u043er s\u0441h\u043e\u043el f\u0435\u0435s \u0430nd \u0456n\u0430b\u0456l\u0456t\u0443 t\u043e \u0430ff\u043erd s\u0441h\u043e\u043el su\u0440\u0440l\u0456\u0435s . \u0397\u0435 gr\u0430du\u0430t\u0435s fr\u043em \u0440r\u0456m\u0430r\u0443 s\u0441h\u043e\u043el w\u0456th \u0430 s\u0441h\u043el\u0430rsh\u0456\u0440 th\u0430t w\u0456ll \u0440\u0430\u0443 f\u043er h\u0456s s\u0435\u0441\u043end\u0430r\u0443 \u0435du\u0441\u0430t\u0456\u043en. \u041c\u0430th\u0430b\u0430n\u0435\u2019s gr\u0430ndm\u043eth\u0435r b\u0435\u0441\u043em\u0435s \u0430 g\u0430rd\u0435n\u0435r f\u043er \u0430 k\u0456nd f\u0430m\u0456l\u0443, th\u0435 Sm\u0456ths, wh\u043e \u0456ntr\u043edu\u0441\u0435 \u039c\u0430th\u0430b\u0430n\u0435 t\u043e b\u043e\u043eks \u0430nd t\u0435nn\u0456s b\u0443 s\u0435nd\u0456ng b\u043e\u043eks \u0430nd \u0435v\u0435n \u0430 t\u0435nn\u0456s r\u0430\u0441k\u0435t h\u043em\u0435 w\u0456th h\u0456s gr\u0430ndm\u043eth\u0435r f\u043er h\u0456m. \u041d\u0435 l\u0435\u0430rns \u0415ngl\u0456sh fr\u043em th\u0435s\u0435 b\u043e\u043eks, \u0430nd b\u0435g\u0456ns t\u043e \u0440l\u0430\u0443 t\u0435nn\u0456s fr\u0435qu\u0435ntl\u0443, \u0435v\u0435ntu\u0430ll\u0443 b\u0435fr\u0456\u0435nd\u0456ng \u0430 bl\u0430\u0441k t\u0435nn\u0456s \u0440l\u0430\u0443\u0435r wh\u043e tr\u0430\u0456ns h\u0456m. \u039c\u0430th\u0430b\u0430n\u0435 j\u043e\u0456ns th\u0435 h\u0456gh s\u0441h\u043e\u043el t\u0435nn\u0456s t\u0435\u0430m \u0430nd b\u0435g\u0456ns t\u043e \u0440l\u0430\u0443 \u0456n t\u043eurn\u0430m\u0435nts, un\u043eff\u0456\u0441\u0456\u0430ll\u0443 s\u0440\u043ens\u043er\u0435d b\u0443 W\u0456lfr\u0435d \u0397\u043ern, \u043ewn\u0435r \u043ef th\u0435 \u0422\u0435nn\u0456s R\u0430n\u0441h. \u0406t \u0456s t\u0435\u0441hn\u0456\u0441\u0430ll\u0443 \u0456ll\u0435g\u0430l f\u043er \u039c\u0430rk t\u043e \u0440l\u0430\u0443 th\u0435r\u0435, but th\u0435 l\u0430w \u0456s \u0456gn\u043er\u0435d \u0430nd h\u0435 b\u0435\u0441\u043em\u0435s \u0441\u043emf\u043ert\u0430bl\u0435 w\u0456th wh\u0456t\u0435s. \u0415v\u0435ntu\u0430ll\u0443 r\u0435n\u043ewn\u0435d t\u0435nn\u0456s \u0440l\u0430\u0443\u0435r St\u0430n Sm\u0456th t\u0430k\u0435s \u039c\u0430th\u0430b\u0430n\u0435 und\u0435r h\u0456s w\u0456ng wh\u0435n th\u0435 tw\u043e m\u0435\u0435t \u0430t \u0430 t\u043eurn\u0430m\u0435nt.

Initially, I contemplated allocating part of the funds to create a foundation for our employees and taking the rest in stock and cash.

There is widespread speculation about a potential ten billion pound deficit in the government's finances, a claim that the Chancellor has refuted. Vince Cable remarked that the public is left uncertain about whom to trust, emphasizing that it is the responsibility of the National Audit Office to make that determination. In reaction to the pre-budget report, he criticized the government's tax system as being unfair and excessively complicated. Mr. Brown, in his report, maintained his golden rule that borrowing should solely be for investment purposes, not for everyday expenses. However, Mr. Vince argued that the public is unable to discern whether to trust the Chancellor or the prevailing opinion among economists that this rule has been violated. \u201cThis is a matter of credibility and trust. The era in which the Chancellor sets his own standards and evaluates them is over. We require an equivalent of an Ofsted review of government finances.\u201d He questioned what the government might be concealing. He accused the Chancellor of avoiding tough decisions, stating, \u201cSignificant challenges lie ahead due to a declining dollar, a steep drop in the housing market, and increasing personal debt.\u201d Yet, he noted that the Chancellor had not yet confronted these issues. He pointed out that Mr. Brown had allocated an additional \u00a3520 million for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, contrasting this with the \u00a3500 million that Britain spent during the entirety of the first Gulf War, most of which was funded by other European and Arab nations. The government also planned to invest \u00a33 billion in identity cards. He argued that Britain could not afford the kind of reckless tax cuts proposed by the Conservatives, reminiscent of George Bush's policies. Instead, he advocated for a simplification of the tax system. He highlighted that 40% of all pensioners were paying a top tax rate of 50%, and that one and a half million families were facing a top rate of 60%. He questioned why, given these statistics, the government was opposing the Liberal Democrats\u2019 suggestion for a new 50p top rate of income tax for the wealthiest individuals. Mr. Brown had also committed \u00a31 billion to help minimize council tax increases. However, Mr. Vince contended that this funding was being sourced from health and education budgets. He called for the complete abolition of council tax, deeming it profoundly unfair, and proposed replacing it with a local income tax.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Nin's use of the term incest in this context is metaphorical rather than literal. In other words, in this book, the term \"incest\" refers to a selfish love where one can only appreciate in another what is similar to oneself. This leads to a situation where one is solely loving oneself, rejecting all differences. Initially, such self-love may appear ideal because it is devoid of fear and risk. However, it ultimately transforms into a barren nightmare. Toward the conclusion of the book, the character known as \"the modern Christ\" contextualizes Nin's use of the term: \u201cIf only we could all escape from this house of incest, where we only love ourselves in the other.\u201d Nin was under the analysis of Otto Rank during the time she was writing House of Incest. Rank was an early disciple of Freud, serving as the secretary and youngest member of his Vienna group, but he had long since diverged from Freudian orthodoxy and developed his own theoretical framework. Incest: From a Journal of Love\"\u2014The Unexpurgated Diary of Ana\u00efs Nin (1932\u20131934) reveals that the two were also involved in an affair. Rank assisted Ana\u00efs in editing House of Incest. He had experience with this subject, as Otto Rank's most renowned work is The Trauma of Birth. House of Incest is largely an attempt by the narrator to cope with the shock of the trauma of birth. Ana\u00efs Nin describes the process as akin to being \"[e]jected from a paradise of soundlessness... thrown up on a rock, the skeleton of a ship choked in its own sails.\""}, {"role": "assistant",

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nA pastor, who has a large family with his wife Am\u00e9lie, adopts a young blind girl named Gertrude, whom his daughter Charlotte has taken a liking to. The pastor's love for Gertrude is reminiscent of Beethoven's Sixth Symphony, also known as the Pastoral Symphony, which he takes her to hear. However, this symphony also symbolizes the complex relationship between the pastor and Gertrude, which is a symphony of its own. Am\u00e9lie, the pastor's wife, is increasingly resentful of Gertrude, as she feels the pastor is devoting more attention to the young girl than to their own children. Am\u00e9lie tries to bring the pastor's feelings to the surface, but he remains oblivious to the true nature of his emotions. As a devout man, the pastor tries to shield Gertrude from the harsh realities of the world, including the concept of sin, and in doing so, he inadvertently fosters a deep affection between them. When the pastor's eldest son, Jacques, who is around the same age as Gertrude, expresses his desire to marry her, the pastor becomes jealous and refuses, despite Jacques' genuine love for her. Eventually, Gertrude undergoes surgery to restore her eyesight, and upon regaining her vision, she is disillusioned by the reality of her situation. In a desperate attempt to escape her newfound understanding, she tries to take her own life by jumping into a river, but is rescued and contracts pneumonia. As she lies on her deathbed, she reveals to the pastor that the man she had idealized in her blindness was actually Jacques, not him."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nIt is about a pastor who adopts a young blind girl whom his daughter, Charlotte, names \"Gertrude\". The title refers to Beethoven's Sixth Symphony (also known as the Pastoral Symphony) which the pastor takes Gertrude to hear. It also refers to the pastor's own symphony with Gertrude. His wife, Am\u00e9lie, resents Gertrude because the pastor dedicates more attention to Gertrude than to their five children. She tries to prompt him to a recognition of the true nature of his feelings for the young woman in his care. Her ability to \"see\" this is contrasted with the \"blindness\" of the pastor in this regard and the reader is invited to judge him on his intellectual dishonesty. As a religious man, the pastor takes the Bible very seriously and tries to preserve Gertrude's innocence by protecting her from the concept of sin. Because the pastor is really the main character in Gertrude's limited world, she feels herself to be in love with him and to some extent he has similar feelings toward her. When his eldest son Jacques, who is about the same age as Gertrude, asks to marry her the pastor becomes jealous and refuses despite the fact that Jacques is obviously in love with her. Gertrude eventually gets an operation to repair her eyesight and, having regained the ability to see, realizes that things are not as beautiful as the pastor made them seem. She attempts suicide by jumping into a river, but is rescued and contracts pneumonia. She realizes that the pastor is an old man, and the man she pictured when she was blind was Jacques. She tells the pastor this shortly before her death."}]

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nIn recent years, deep learning has achieved significant advancements in various applications, including image detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, and speech recognition. However, this progress has also raised a pressing concern: deep networks are highly susceptible to adversarial examples. These examples are carefully crafted inputs that are designed to deceive the model into misclassifying them. In the realms of images and speech, the modifications required to create these examples are so subtle that they go unnoticed by humans, yet they have a profound impact on the model's classification.\n\nDeep learning models have been successfully applied to malware detection, a domain where generating adversarial examples is particularly challenging. This is because even minor modifications to the binary code of a file can significantly alter its functionality and validity. To address this issue, we have developed a novel loss function specifically designed for generating adversarial examples from discrete input sets, such as executable bytes. By injecting a small sequence of bytes (payload) into malicious binaries, we can modify them to evade detection while preserving their original functionality. We have applied this approach to an end-to-end convolutional deep learning malware detection model and demonstrated a high rate of detection evasion. Furthermore, our generated payload has been shown to be robust and transferable across different locations within the same file and across different files, with an entropy level similar to that of benign data sections."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nIn recent years, deep learning has shown performance breakthroughs in many\napplications, such as image detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, and\nspeech recognition.

[{"role": "user", "content": " \u2019TIS Christmas, and the North wind howls; it was just yesterday, two years ago, that I stood at the bow of the Lusitania, gazing over Table Bay. A traveler circling the globe, a seeker of the sea, anticipating the moment her sails would unfurl to head back home. \u2019TIS Christmas, and the North wind howls; today our hearts are united, even though you are amidst the English snow while I bask in the Australian sun. You, when the Northern wind blows, stack up a grander fire, while our ladies huddle until it passes, dressed in their lawn and lace. I can almost envision you on this Christmas night, sitting just as you used to, laughter filling the air: then a sudden, quiet pause interrupts your joy, and kind eyes glisten as you happen to think of me. This morning, upon waking and realizing it was Christmas once more, I nearly imagined I could see white frost on the windowpane, hear the wheels ringing on the icy ground, and watch the drip that slowly descends in its frozen casing. I suppose you\u2019ll be on the lake or gliding over the snow, warming your hands to get the blood flowing, snuggling your nose in the furs of your boa\u2014while here, the thermometer reads a hundred in the shade. It doesn\u2019t quite feel like Christmas here with this clear sky, this pure, transparent air, this sun high in the heavens; to see the rose blooming on the bush, young leaves sprouting on the trees, and hear the summer hush of the forest or the gentle buzz of bees. But cold winds don\u2019t bring Christmas, nor do budding roses signal June, and when it\u2019s night on your side, we\u2019re enjoying the noon. Kind hearts create Christmas\u2014June can bring either blue skies or clouds overhead; the only true universal spring is that which arises from love. Thus, it\u2019s Christmas in the South just as it is on the North Sea shores, even though we suffer from summer drought while you endure winter frosts. We\u2019ll have our roast beef here and think of you while we eat, even though the vast ocean separates us from the mother isle.

Just the thought of it being viewed abroad was unsettling. It's astonishing how one submarine can endure 40 depth charges while another might be incapacitated by just two. Additionally, I think it would be nearly impossible for Americans to commandeer a German sub and vice versa.<br/><br/>However, the most frustrating aspect of this movie is its pretentious rewriting of history. It was the British who first captured the enigma machine, NOT the Americans. We have no right to claim credit for the achievements of other nations. Hollywood simply displays a historical ignorance.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nAcademy Award-nominated actor Liam Neeson recently hosted a dinner party in New York to raise awareness and funds for Belfast's Lyric Theatre. The Ballymena-born actor expressed his concern about the theatre's current state, describing it as being in a \"very dilapidated condition.\" Lyric Theatre chairman David Johnston stated that rebuilding the theatre, which is estimated to cost \u00a38 million, is the only viable solution.\n\nNeeson, who has appeared in films such as Schindler's List, Michael Collins, and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, explained that the idea behind the dinner party was to gather a group of \"healthy, wealthy Irish Americans\" in one room and ask for their support in fundraising efforts. The Lyric Theatre, which has been in operation for 50 years, has played a significant role in Northern Ireland's cultural and social life.\n\nNeeson, who has a strong connection to Northern Ireland, particularly the Glens of Antrim, where his spirit belongs, spoke fondly of the theatre's impact on his life and career. He credited the theatre's founder, Mary O'Malley, with giving him his start in the profession. Neeson recalled the theatre's heyday in the 1970s, when it was a beacon of hope and light in a troubled Belfast, hosting productions from Shakespeare to Yeats to O'Casey.\n\nThe Lyric Theatre has a long history, dating back to 1968, and has launched the careers of notable actors such as Adrian Dunbar and Stephen Rea, as well as playwrights like Martin Lynch and Gary Mitchell. Speaking to the BBC Northern Ireland before the event at New York's SoHo House, Neeson expressed his admiration for Ian Paisley, the DUP leader and preacher, whom he would love to portray on the big screen. Neeson described Paisley as a \"very dynamic, extraordinary figure\" and recalled listening to his sermons on Friday nights in Ballymena."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n\u041d\u043ell\u0443w\u043e\u043ed f\u0456lm st\u0430r L\u0456\u0430m \u039d\u0435\u0435s\u043en h\u0430s h\u0435ld \u0430 d\u0456nn\u0435r \u0440\u0430rt\u0443 \u0456n \u039d\u0435w Y\u043erk t\u043e \u0440r\u043em\u043et\u0435 \u0392\u0435lf\u0430st's L\u0443r\u0456\u0441 \u03a4h\u0435\u0430tr\u0435.\n\u03a4h\u0435 \u0392\u0430ll\u0443m\u0435n\u0430-b\u043ern \u0430\u0441t\u043er s\u0430\u0456d th\u0430t th\u0435 th\u0435\u0430tr\u0435 \u043en R\u0456dg\u0435w\u0430\u0443 Str\u0435\u0435t w\u0430s \u0456n \u0430 \"v\u0435r\u0443 d\u0456l\u0430\u0440\u0456d\u0430t\u0435d \u0441\u043end\u0456t\u0456\u043en\".

However, I've been searching for you, and I'm left with no way of knowing how you feel about me, especially since you promised to remember me. We were young back then, and I'm still young now, but I'm also confused about it all. Should I be giving up on someone this early in my life? Should someone as young as 16 be this down on someone? Honestly, who knows, and who cares? I finally found a way to reach out to you, but I have no idea what you'll say or how you'll react to hearing my name and knowing that I'm thinking of you. Did you forget about me, or did you keep that promise you made to me the last day we spent together? I may never find out, but I'm going to try.

While it does feature shirtless actors engaging in intense fight scenes and attractive actresses wearing bikinis, the film's underlying message and plot are worth exploring.\n\nAt its core, the movie is about taking responsibility for one's actions, managing emotions, and making wise decisions. It's a story that delves into the motivations behind the characters' actions, rather than just focusing on the physical aspects of the plot.\n\nYes, the movie is geared towards a teenage audience, with characters from wealthy backgrounds and a setting that includes expensive cars and large mansions. However, these elements are merely the backdrop for the story. The real focus is on the characters' personal growth and the choices they make. It's not a shallow action film or a series of gratuitous fight scenes.\n\nWhile the movie may not be the best of the year, it's definitely not as bad as people expect. If you're looking for a rental or a movie to watch in theaters, it's worth considering. I believe the negative reception is largely due to the misleading advertising, which tries to sell the movie as a generic \"fight film.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nThe advertisements for this movie do it serious injustice.

While there is no shortage of either, the movie has a strong underlying theme and a decent plot.<br/><br/>At the thematic level, the movie is about accepting responsibility for your actions, controlling your emotions, and making good choices. It's as much about motivations as macho.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a teen-targeted movie. You've got rich kids running around in massive mansions driving expensive cars, but that's just the setting.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nWe propose adapting segmentation networks with a constrained formulation, which embeds domain-invariant prior knowledge about the segmentation regions. This knowledge can take the form of simple anatomical information, such as structure size or shape, estimated from source samples or known prior information. Our method imposes domain-invariant inequality constraints on the network outputs of unlabeled target samples. It implicitly matches prediction statistics between target and source domains with permitted uncertainty of prior knowledge. We address our constrained problem with a differentiable penalty, fully suited for standard stochastic gradient descent approaches, removing the need for computationally expensive Lagrangian optimization with dual projects. Unlike current two-step adversarial training, our formulation is based on a single loss in a single network, which simplifies adaptation by avoiding extra adversarial steps, while improving convergence and quality of training.\n\nThe comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art adversarial methods reveals substantially better performance on the challenging task of adapting spine segmentation across different MRI modalities. Our results also show robustness to impression of size priors, approaching the accuracy of a fully supervised model trained directly in a target domain.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for cross-modality medical image segmentation has demonstrated significant advancements through domain-invariant feature learning or image appearance translation. Adapted feature learning typically struggles to identify domain shifts at the pixel level and fails to yield satisfactory results in dense semantic segmentation tasks. Image appearance translation, such as CycleGAN, effectively transforms images into various styles with appealing results; however, maintaining semantic consistency is challenging, leading to subpar cross-modality segmentation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce intra- and cross-modality semantic consistency (ICMSC) for UDA, with our primary insight being that the segmentation of synthesized images in different styles should remain consistent. Specifically, our model comprises an image translation module and a domain-specific segmentation module. The image translation module is a standard CycleGAN, while the segmentation module includes two domain-specific segmentation networks. The intra-modality semantic consistency (IMSC) compels the reconstructed image after a cycle to be segmented in the same manner as the original input image, whereas the cross-modality semantic consistency (CMSC) encourages the synthesized images post-translation to be segmented exactly as they were before translation. Comprehensive experimental results on cross-modality hip joint bone segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving an average DICE of 81.61% on the acetabulum and 88.16% on the proximal femur, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. It is important to note that without UDA, a model trained on CT for hip joint bone segmentation is non-transferable to MRI and has nearly zero-DICE segmentation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nThe Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) is a specialized therapy program designed for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This program is built on the idea that developing dynamic intelligence is crucial for autistic individuals to lead fulfilling lives. At its core, RDI focuses on helping autistic individuals form genuine emotional connections by gradually introducing them to these experiences in a structured manner. The primary goal of RDI is to equip individuals with the motivation and skills necessary to engage in meaningful social interactions, addressing common social interaction deficits associated with autism. RDI emphasizes the development of essential skills, such as referencing, emotion sharing, coregulation, and experience sharing, which typically emerge during early childhood and adulthood. This family-centered program involves trained professionals who work with parents to modify their communication and interaction styles. The process begins with the child's education, followed by an assessment of both the parent and the child-parent interaction. Consultants then provide parents with tailored strategies to foster a \"guided participation\" partnership between parents and child, encouraging the child to become a \"cognitive apprentice\" once again. Once this partnership is established, parents can focus on implementing developmentally staged strategies aimed at restoring optimal neural connectivity through a series of \"innovations\" and \"elaborations\" to support the child's neural remediation goals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nRelationship Technology Assistance (RDI) is a trademarked proprietary therapy program for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), based on the notion that the growth of dynamic intelligence is the key to maintaining the quality of life for autistic individuals.

Technology stocks, especially PC manufacturers, have been significantly affected: Compaq has decreased by 34 percent from its peak, Dell has fallen 68 percent, and Gateway has dropped 76 percent.  \nThis downturn is impacting the entire supply chain. Intel, which relies heavily on PC manufacturers for a substantial portion of its semiconductor sales, has seen a 56 percent decline. Meanwhile, Applied Materials [AMAT], the top producer of semiconductor equipment, has experienced a 66 percent drop.  \nI don't think the future for these stocks is as dire as their recent performance indicates. Admittedly, the crucial fourth-quarter season does not appear very promising. The most pessimistic analysts suggest that PCs are becoming akin to television sets\u2014commodities that are primarily differentiated by price. They argue that without the ability to command premium prices for additional features, already slim profit margins will further erode. However, over the next five years, sales for leading companies in the PC sector are expected to grow by 12 percent to 15 percent annually, with earnings potentially increasing by 16 percent to 20 percent or more.  \nThe upcoming months may be challenging, but they should present excellent long-term buying opportunities for investors. In my opinion, the standout opportunity is Applied Materials, which has the potential to grow profits by an average of 25 percent annually.  \nThe main drawback of the stock is its significant volatility. Even when it appears inexpensive, it can decline further if the technology sector continues to struggle. Additionally, since two-thirds of its sales come from international markets, Applied Materials is vulnerable to global economic fluctuations, including the weak euro and issues in Asia. In fact, I have previously recommended this stock at higher prices, only to see it drop even lower.  \nAt this juncture, however, I don't foresee it falling much further. Analysts have revised earnings projections for the current fiscal year (ending October 1, 2001) from $3.50 per share two months ago to as low as $2.10 today. Yet, even based on these lowered estimates, at $38.50 per share, the stock is trading at under 19 times earnings, or just 0.8 times its long-term growth rate.  \nBusiness conditions may remain tough through the first half of 2001, and some analysts predict the stock could dip to $33 or $34 before hitting a bottom. However, conditions should improve in the latter half of the year. Given that the stock could easily trade at more than double its current price in a more favorable market, the potential upside appears ten times greater than the downside.  \n###  \nShare your thoughts on Michael's column at:  \nhttp://www.money.com/depts/investing/sivy/index.html  \nTo subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks, visit:  \nhttp://www.money.com/email/  \nEarnings Releases and Calls  \nFor the latest corporate earnings releases and online conference calls, click on: http://money.ccbn.com  \n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  \nSpecial Internet Offer!!!  \nSign up for a RISK-FREE issue of MONEY MAGAZINE at  \nhttp://www.money.com/subscribe2  \nOr if you prefer, call our toll-free number 1-800-544-4594  \n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  \nFrom time to time, we may reach out to you with offers for Time Inc. products and services that we believe may interest you.  \nIf you would prefer not to receive such communications, AND YOU DID NOT INDICATE THIS PREFERENCE WHEN YOU SIGNED UP for the Sivy on Stocks online newsletter or any other Time Inc. online newsletters, please inform us by sending an email to <no_solicit@money.com>.  \nAdditionally, we may occasionally share your email address with select companies"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nDate: Mon, 4 Dec 2000 10:44:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sivy@listserv.pathfinder.com\nTo: sivy@listserv.pathfinder.com\nSubject: Sivy on Stocks: Nasdaq crash victim\nBody: \nSIVY ON STOCKS from money.com\nDecember 4, 2000\n=========================================\nCHAT TONIGHT:\nMonday, December 4 at 8pm ET, 5pm PT\nMichael Sivy identifies sectors and stocks that\npossess true value in a rocky market.\nAOL users go to Keyword: Live\nhttp://www.money.com/chat/\n=========================================\nNasdaq crash victim\nApplied Materials has fallen to fire-sale prices.\nBy Michael Sivy\nThe Dow may be down only 10 percent from its 52-week high, but the Nasdaq\nis in the middle of a screaming bear market, down nearly 50 percent from\nits high in March.

[{"role": "user", "content": " The BBC's premier pop music show, Top of the Pops, is set to transition from BBC One on Fridays to Sundays on BBC Two. The revamped program will merge with the archival series TOTP2, blending contemporary music with clips of legendary bands. The corporation stated that the new format \"aims to attract a varied audience of music enthusiasts.\" This change marks the most significant transformation in the show's history, which debuted in 1964 and has consistently aired on BBC One. Top of the Pops was reintroduced with much fanfare last December in an effort to counter a prolonged decline in viewership.\n\nThe All New Top of the Pops was hosted by newcomer Tim Kash and produced by Andi Peters, who returned to the BBC from Channel 4 to rejuvenate the series. Approximately three million viewers tuned in on Fridays, which is less than half of the audience it garnered in the mid-1990s, as it competed with the popular ITV soap Coronation Street. However, despite the relaunch, audience numbers did not improve and remained around the three million mark. Tim Kash has since been succeeded as host by Fearne Cotton. The new format is set to debut in Spring next year with an expanded presentation. BBC Two controller Roly Keating remarked: \"It's an exciting new chapter for Top of the Pops. We aim to enhance it so that it becomes the ultimate pop music program for fans of all ages.\" Mr. Keating referred to BBC Two as the \"natural home\" for Top of the Pops and added: \"The inclusion of Top of the Pops will also broaden BBC Two's appeal to younger viewers.\"\n\nA BBC spokesperson confirmed that Andi Peters will continue as the executive producer of the show. She mentioned that discussions regarding the precise format and time slot of the program are still ongoing. The show will maintain a close connection with the BBC Radio 1 chart show, indicating that the relaunched version may air around 1900 on Sundays. \"We hope that the audience for Top of the Pops will find it on BBC Two.

The programme will have a close relationship with the BBC Radio 1 chart show, which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on Sundays. \"Hopefully the audience for Top of the Pops will find it on BBC Two. \"We think that the new slot will create a buzz around the programme as for the first time viewers will discover the news of who is number one as it happens.\""}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware segmentation) presents a significant challenge when segmenting individual cell nuclei in fluorescence microscopy images.\n\nDeep Neural Networks have the capability to learn the implicit transformation of a nuclear image into a probability map that indicates the class membership of each pixel (nucleus or background). However, relying on post-processing steps to convert the probability map into a labeled object mask can lead to errors. This is particularly true for nuclear images derived from tissue sections and those obtained from various tissue preparation methods.\n\nIn this study, we aim to assess the effectiveness of cutting-edge deep learning architectures for segmenting nuclei in fluorescence images from diverse tissue sources and sample preparation techniques without the need for post-processing. We compare architectures that function on pixel-to-pixel translation with one that focuses on object detection followed by localized segmentation.\n\nAdditionally, we introduce an innovative approach to generate artificial images to enhance the training dataset.\n\nWe investigate how the quality of ground truth annotations, image scale, and the complexity of segmentation affect segmentation performance. The results indicate that three out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34 backbone, Mask R-CNN) can effectively segment fluorescent nuclear images across most sample preparation types and tissue origins, achieving satisfactory segmentation results. Among these, Mask R-CNN, which is specifically designed for instance-aware segmentation tasks, outperforms the other architectures.

[{"role": "user", "content": " This film is far more profound and certainly richer than one might assume from the overly sentimental trailers that many have encountered. The underlying narrative, which slowly unveils the early years of P.L. Travers, the creator of Mary Poppins, and illustrates how her troubled family influenced her to write Mary Poppins, forms the genuine essence of this film. I will never view Mary Poppins in the same light again. The performances are outstanding, and the soundtrack is remarkable. This is not the superficial, childish film that many might anticipate. I would advise against it for children aged 11 and under, depending on the individual child. Otherwise, I strongly endorse this film, even if you are not particularly fond of the original Mary Poppins movie."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nThis movie is much more than and definitely deeper than one would suspect from the 'syrupy' trailers most people have seen. The understory, gradually revealing the early life of P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, and depicting how the people in her dysfunctional family led her to write Mary Poppins, is the true core of this movie. I will never see Mary Poppins in quite the same way. All of the acting is superior, and the score is excellent. This is not the shallow, childlike movie that many will expect. I would not recommend it for children 11 and under, depending on the child. Otherwise, I highly recommend this movie, even if you are not a big fan of the original Mary Poppins film."}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nTo make this delicious and flavorful chicken broth, you will need the following ingredients:\n\n- 8 cups of Reduced Fat/Reduced Sodium Chicken Broth\n- 2 cups of Water\n- 2-1/2 pounds of Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast (I used Frozen)\n- 1 whole Medium Yellow Onion, Quartered\n- 1 bunch of Cilantro (washed, Stems Trimmed)\n- 6 cloves of Garlic, Peeled\n- 2 whole Serano Peppers (stems Removed, Seeds Removed if Desired for Less Heat, See Note)\n- 1 can (10 Oz. Size) of Ro-tel (diced Tomatoes with Green Chilies)\n- 1 can (15 Oz. Size) of Tomato Sauce\n- 1 can (6 Oz. Size) of Tomato Paste\n- 4 teaspoons of Cumin\n- 2 teaspoons of Garlic Salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon of Chili Powder\n- 2-1/2 tablespoons of Cornstarch Combined with Below Amount of Water\n- 1/2 cups of Water\n- 1 can (15 Oz. Size) of Corn, Drained\n- Optional Toppings: Shredded Cheese or Sour Cream\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In your largest soup pot, combine the broth, water, chicken breasts, and bring to a slow boil.\n2. Using a large food processor or blender, combine the onion, cilantro, garlic, peppers, and Ro-tel, and blend until smooth.\n3. Once the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside, remove from the broth and set aside.\n4. Pour the spicy blend from the food processor into the broth and set to simmer.\n5. Add the tomato sauce, paste, cumin, salt, and chili powder. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally.\n6. Once the tomato paste has dissolved, combine the cornstarch with the cold water in a small bowl or cup and stir until completely dissolved. Stir into the broth and continue to simmer.\n7. It's time to shred the chicken. You can do this using 2 forks (and perhaps a little kitchen helper) but I prefer to use the shredding attachment on my food processor.\n8. Turn the heat down to just below a simmer or slow boil. Add the shredded chicken.\n9. Stir in the corn and cook until heated through.\n10. Top with cheese or sour cream and serve with tortilla chips or corn bread. The leftovers are fabulous, as the flavors continue to develop over time. This soup freezes well. Note: Serano peppers can pack some serious heat. 2 small peppers provided the perfect amount of heat for me. My husband loves this soup when I make it using 2 medium or large peppers. Adjust the size of the peppers to fit your preferences."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n8\u200b \u200bc\u200bu\u200bp\u200bs\u200b

[{"role": "user", "content": " Marco Anelli (born October 31, 1968, in Roma) is an Italian photographer. He commenced his career in Paris, where he focused on black-and-white printing techniques. His photographic research projects have developed over extended periods and have explored various subjects. His publications feature works on architecture, landscape, portraiture, sports, and classical music. In 2010, he conducted Portraits in the Presence of Marina Abramovic, (Damiani, 2010) capturing the 1,545 participants in The Artist Is Present by Marina Abramovic at the MoMA, New York. In Building Magazzino (Rizzoli, 2017), he documented the transformation of an old computer factory into Magazzino Italian Art, a new art space in Cold Spring, NY, co-founded by Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu. Artist Studios New York (Damiani, 2020) examines the character and creative space of globally renowned artists such as Alex Katz, Cecily Brown, Francesco Clemente, Joan Jonas, John Giorno, Julian Schnabel, Kiki Smith, Lawrence Weiner, Matthew Barney, Robert Longo, Shirin Neshat, Ugo Rondinone, and Urs Fisher. TINO, Nivola in America is his most recent published book (Silvana Editoriale and Magazzino Italian Art, 2021), in which Anelli\u2019s photographic research centers on Costantino Nivola\u2019s sculptures scattered throughout the US."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nM\u200ba\u200br\u200bc\u200bo\u200b \u200bA\u200bn\u200be\u200bl\u200bl\u200bi\u200b

However, the song's credits were later revised to feature Stone Sour as the performing artist. This song marked a significant milestone for the band, catapulting them into the mainstream music scene. The album cover showcases Taylor's hands adorned with distinctive rings, including a Spider-Man ring that pays homage to the band's contribution to the Spider-Man film soundtrack.

[{"role": "user", "content": " Cluster states can be utilized to carry out measurement-based quantum computation. The cluster state serves as a valuable resource, as once it is generated, only local operations and measurements are required to execute universal quantum computation. In this paper, we investigate methods for rapidly and deterministically constructing a cluster state. Specifically, we focus on generating cluster states on a qubus quantum computer, a computational architecture that employs a continuous variable ancilla to facilitate interactions between qubits. We examine various techniques for building the cluster, with the number of operations needed varying based on whether we permit the ability to eliminate previously established controlled-phase links between qubits. In scenarios where we cannot destroy these links, we demonstrate how to create an n x m cluster using just 3n - 2n - 3m/2 + 3 operations. This results in more than a factor of 2 savings compared to a naive method. Additional savings can be achieved if we incorporate the ability to destroy links, in which case we only need (8n - 4n - 4m - 8)/3 operations. Unfortunately, the latter scheme is more complex, making the selection of the correct order to interact the qubits considerably more challenging. A halfway scheme, which maintains a modular generation while saving additional operations over never destroying links, requires only 3n - 2n - 2m + 4 operations. The first scheme and the last scheme are the most practical for constructing a cluster state because they break down the generation into the repetition of simple sections."}, {"role": "assistant",

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nThe trend of prioritizing individual storylines and moments in creative writing has become increasingly prevalent. This shift began after Bryan's success at WrestleMania 30, where he was subsequently deemed to have had his moment and it was time for Roman to take the spotlight. Since then, it seems like every major event revolves around a specific wrestler's turn or moment. While it's heartwarming to see multiple individuals achieve memorable moments, this approach leads to a never-ending cycle of wrestlers entering and exiting the main event scene, only to make way for the next person. A prime example of this would be if, after Austin's win at WrestleMania 14, it was said that he had had his moment and now it was Jeff Jarrett's time to shine. Unfortunately, many of these moments feel more like an opportunity for a random wrestler to gain relevance rather than a genuine narrative-driven plot. For instance, did Nia Jax truly need a moment after beating Bliss, or was it simply a case of giving her something to do? This overemphasis on individual moments detracts from the overall storytelling experience."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nIt's the death of creative and narrative driven writing. It's been a common thing ever since Bryan won at wm30, and then the next year it wasn't \"fair\" for him to be in the main event again because he had his moment and now it's Roman's turn. Since then it feels like everything is about someone getting their moment, or their turn. It's nice, of course, that a lot of people get to do something memorable but it leads to this constantly cycling people in and out of main events and then stepping aside for someone else. Imagine after Austin won at WM14 it was said that he had his moment and now it was time for Jeff Jarrett to have his? And so many of them aren't even moments so much as \"random wrestler finally gets something useful to do\" or something. Like did Nia Jax need a moment the year she beat Bliss, for example? It's just one of those branding things that really, really takes me out of the whole thing."}]

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nThe book starts by delving into the history of war crimes, dating back to the medieval period's \"knightly chivalry.\" These rules were established to minimize unnecessary cruelty during warfare and protect civilian populations from massacres and the spread of disease. As a result, the immunity granted to soldiers from being held criminally responsible for murder committed during warfare had to be carefully balanced to discourage wartime atrocities.\n\nUntil 1863, when U.S. President Abraham Lincoln approved the \"Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field,\" the laws of war remained largely unwritten. This 159-article document facilitated the formation of military tribunals and later led to a demand for the formalization of international laws of warfare. The Hague and Geneva conventions, a series of treaties, codified these international laws of warfare, binding all nations, whether signatory or not, to international laws of war.\n\nThe Nuremberg Trials, in which Taylor played a leading role, had significant consequences for international law as applied to warfare. It granted international jurisdiction to the prosecution of war crimes and obligated individuals engaged in warfare to adhere to international laws of conduct over and above those of their respective armies. The United States, as a result of its participation in the Nuremberg trials, emerged as legally, morally, and politically bound to the principles that resulted from the trials.\n\nTaylor's primary concern in this book is how the principles of the Nuremberg trials would apply to the United States' conduct of the Vietnam War. When \"Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy\" was published, those in favor and opposition to the United States' involvement in Vietnam frequently cited the Nuremberg trials in support of their positions. Those in favor of U.S. involvement argued that North Vietnam's attack on South Vietnam justified the use of force, and this allowed the United States to join with South Vietnam. Those opposed to U.S. involvement asserted that both South Vietnam and the United States violated the Geneva Declaration of 1954 by attacking North Vietnam and preventing national elections.\n\nTaylor points out that the definition of \"aggressive warfare\" is ambiguous, hindering any attempt to determine which belligerent power involved in the Vietnam War could be deemed the \"aggressor.\" This ambiguity raises related questions, such as the legality of refusing to serve in Vietnam. Many conscientious objectors refused to serve in Vietnam on the grounds that their complicity in an illegal war made them guilty of crimes against humanity. Taylor cites possible war crimes in regard to the Son My incident, also known as the My Lai Massacre of 1968.\n\nIn this portion of the book, Taylor makes a compelling comparison of Nuremberg to the Vietnam War by juxtaposing two eyewitness accounts: one from the Holocaust and the other from the My Lai Massacre. Taylor explains the differences between the two accounts and shows the difficulty in determining whether or not crimes were committed by the United States. He also raises domestic problems with regard to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, arguing that both the President and the Congress bear responsibility for officially declaring military action in Vietnam. According to Taylor, the Vietnam War could only be ended by an act of national will, rather than by judicial means."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nThe book begins with a lengthy history of war crimes beginning with the \u201cknightly chivalry\u201d of the medieval period. \n\nThese rules were put into place in order to minimize unnecessary cruelties during the course of warfare. \n\nThe rules protected civilian populations from massacre and the needless spread of disease. Thus, the blanket of immunity that protects soldiers from being held criminally responsible for murder committed during the course of warfare had to be carefully balanced so as to discourage wartime atrocities. \n\nThe laws of war remained largely unwritten until U.S. President Abraham Lincoln approved the \u201cInstructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field\u201d, in 1863. \n\nConcerning spies, prisoners of war, and the punishment of war crimes, this document comprising 159 articles facilitated the formation of military tribunals and later led to a demand for the formalization of international laws of warfare. Thus, international laws of warfare were codified by means of a series of treaties known as the Hague and Geneva conventions. \n\nThe most important consequence of these treaties is that all nations, whether signatory or otherwise, were bound by international laws of war. The Nuremberg Trials, for which Taylor served as a leading figure, gave rise to several developments in regard to international law as applied to warfare. \n\nFirst, it gave international jurisdiction to the prosecution of war crimes; and second, it obligated individuals engaged in warfare to adhere to international laws of conduct over and above those of their respective armies. \n\nOf greatest importance with respect to this book however is that the United States as a result of its participation emerged as legally, morally, and politically bound to the principles that resulted from the Nuremberg trials. Thus, Taylor is concerned by how the principles of the Nuremberg trials would apply to the United States\u2019 conduct of the Vietnam War. \n\nWhen Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy was published, those in favor and opposition to the United States involvement in Vietnam frequently cited the Nuremberg trials in support of their positions. Those in favor of United States involvement argued that North Vietnam attacked South Vietnam in violation of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter; South Vietnam was justified in using force to repel such an attack; and this in turn allowed the United States to join with South Vietnam as provided by Article 51. Those opposed to the United States involvement in the Vietnam War asserted that both South Vietnam and the United States violated the Geneva Declaration of 1954 by attacking North Vietnam, rearming illegally, preventing the 1956 national elections which were provided for in the Declaration, and subsequently bombing North Vietnam. \n\nSuch actions would constitute \u201caggressive warfare\u201d by the standards of Nuremberg. \n\nTaylor points out that the definition of \u201caggressive warfare\u201d is ambiguous, thus severely hindering any attempt to determine which of the belligerent powers involved in the Vietnam War could be deemed the \u201caggressor.\u201d What\u2019s more, such ambiguities lead to several related questions, such as the legality of refusing to serve in Vietnam. At the time, many conscientious objectors refused to serve in Vietnam on the grounds that their complicity in an illegal war made them, by implication, guilty of crimes against humanity. Taylor cites possible war crimes in regard to the Son My incident, which is more commonly known as the My Lai Massacre of 1968 (). It is in this portion of the book that Taylor makes the most convincing comparison of Nuremberg to the Vietnam War. In this section, Taylor quotes two eyewitness accounts, each from a different war. One account, written by a German construction engineer, describes the killing of Jews during the Holocaust by German SS officers in 1942. \n\nThis account is juxtaposed on the adjacent page by an eyewitness account of the My Lai Massacre. \n\nThe accounts are eerily similar, yet Taylor explains all of the differences, and in characteristically unbiased fashion shows the difficulty in determining whether or not crimes were committed by the United States. Taylor also raises domestic problems with regard to the United States\u2019 involvement in the Vietnam War. According to Taylor, it remains to be seen whether the United States Congress or the Executive branch of government held responsibility for officially declaring military action in Vietnam. \n\nIt is the opinion of Taylor that both the President and the Congress bear responsibility, and that the Vietnam War could only be ended by an act of national will, rather than by judicial means."}]

According to the company, its profit after tax for the year ending March 31 is expected to be between 10 and 15 percent lower than the previous year. Virgin Blue's CEO cited the continued poor demand experienced in November and December of last year, which has now carried over into January. As a major player in the Australian market, Virgin Blue has been facing stiff competition from Jetstar, a low-cost carrier launched by Qantas in May last year. In response, Virgin Blue has reduced its forecast for annual passenger numbers by approximately a quarter. This is not the first time the company has faced challenges; in August, Virgin Blue reported a 22% drop in its first-quarter profits due to increased competition. In November, the company warned that its first-half profits would decline due to lower demand and higher fuel costs. Despite its significant market share of a third of the domestic Australian market, Virgin Blue's struggles have been exacerbated by the entry of Jetstar.

[{"role": "user", "content": " The field of view (FOV) in convolutional neural networks is closely linked to the precision of inference. Dilated convolutions are recognized as an effective approach to address issues that necessitate large FOVs. However, when it comes to general-purpose hardware or specialized hardware, it typically requires additional time to process dilated convolutions compared to standard convolutions. In this paper, we introduce a network module, Cascaded and Separable Structure of Dilated (CASSOD) Convolution, along with a dedicated hardware system designed to efficiently manage CASSOD networks. A CASSOD-Net features multiple cascaded $2 \\times 2$ dilated filters, which can replace the conventional $3 \\times 3$ dilated filters without compromising inference accuracy. Two example applications, face detection and image segmentation, are evaluated using dilated convolutions and the proposed CASSOD modules. The new network for face detection achieves superior accuracy compared to previous work, utilizing only 47% of the filter weights in the dilated convolution layers of the context module. Furthermore, the proposed hardware system can significantly speed up the computations of dilated convolutions, operating 2.78 times faster than traditional hardware systems when the filter size is $3

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nTo make this marshmallow recipe, you will need the following ingredients:\n\n- 1 1/4 cups of water, divided\n- 4 (1/4-oz.) envelopes of unflavored gelatin\n- 2 cups of granulated sugar\n- 1 cup of light corn syrup\n- 1/4 teaspoon of table salt\n- 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract\n- 1/2 cup (about 2 1/8 oz.) of powdered sugar\n- 1/4 cup of cornstarch\n\nFirst, place 1/2 cup of the water in a microwave-safe bowl and stir in the gelatin. Set it aside for now. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, salt, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking without stirring until the candy thermometer inserted into the mixture registers 250\u00b0F.\n\nNext, pour the sugar mixture into the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Let the mixture stand until it reaches 210\u00b0F, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, microwave the gelatin mixture on high until the gelatin melts, about 20 seconds, stirring after 10 seconds. On low speed, gradually pour the gelatin mixture into the sugar mixture in a thin stream, adding the vanilla extract. Increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 9 to 10 minutes.\n\nUsing a lightly greased spatula, spread the mixture evenly in a lightly greased 13- x 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Let the mixture stand until it's dry and firm, about 2 hours. Sift together the powdered sugar and cornstarch, and spread them on a rimmed baking sheet. Using a lightly greased offset spatula, remove the marshmallow mixture from the dish and place it in the powdered sugar mixture. Using kitchen shears well coated with the powdered sugar mixture, cut the marshmallows into 1-inch squares. Coat all the cut sides of the marshmallows with the powdered sugar mixture, tossing lightly to remove excess. Store the marshmallows in an airtight container."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n1 1/4 \u0441u\u0440s w\u0430t\u0435r, d\u0456v\u0456d\u0435d\n4 (1/4-\u043ez.) \u0435nv\u0435l\u043e\u0440\u0435s unfl\u0430v\u043er\u0435d g\u0435l\u0430t\u0456n\n2 \u0441u\u0440s gr\u0430nul\u0430t\u0435d sug\u0430r\n1 \u0441u\u0440 l\u0456ght \u0441\u043ern s\u0443ru\u0440\n1/4 t\u0435\u0430s\u0440\u043e\u043en t\u0430bl\u0435 s\u0430lt\n1 t\u0430bl\u0435s\u0440\u043e\u043en v\u0430n\u0456ll\u0430 \u0435\u0445tr\u0430\u0441t\n1/2 \u0441u\u0440 (\u0430b\u043eut 2 1/8 \u043ez.) \u0440\u043ewd\u0435r\u0435d sug\u0430r\n1/4 \u0441u\u0440 \u0441\u043ernst\u0430r\u0441h\n\u03a1l\u0430\u0441\u0435 1/2 \u0441u\u0440 \u043ef th\u0435 w\u0430t\u0435r \u0456n \u0430 m\u0456\u0441r\u043ew\u0430v\u0435-s\u0430f\u0435 b\u043ewl; st\u0456r \u0456n g\u0435l\u0430t\u0456n.

A Financial Times report said that business intelligence firm GPW was understood to be starting diligence work on SSL International for a corporate client.

Eighteen months ago Reckitt Benckiser was at the centre of a rumoured takeover bid for SSL - but that came to nothing. Other firms that have been seen as potential suitors include Kimberly-Clark, Johnson & Johnson, and private equity investors. Analysts have seen SSL as a takeover target for years. It sold off its surgical gloves and antiseptic businesses for \u00a3173m to a management team in May.

My emphasis on the legacy channel aims to boost the chances that more originators can finalize transactions and create deal flow.

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nThe story begins on a fictional planet called Per, where the inhabitants discover the unique abilities of the watch-whers or wherevers, distant relatives of the dragons. These beasts are then used in mines to warn miners of gas pockets and also to locate stranded miners, should there be a cave-in. The story takes place several years before the 3rd Pass in Camp Natalon, a mining camp. There, the reader is introduced to a young boy named Kindan, whose father owns a watch-wher called Dark. During a mining cave-in, Kindan loses his entire family as well as Dark, and is adopted by the Master Harper Zist, who begins to train him to be both an entertainer and a spy, something that Harpers do. This is how Kindan learns that the camp is divided into two parts, Natalon's and his uncle, Tari's. Meanwhile, the camp is without a watch-wher and minor accidents keep delaying the work. Despite the protests from Tari and his group, Natalon decides to trade an entire winter's worth of coal for a chance for Kindan to ask a queen watch-wher for an egg. He succeeds and begins the difficult task of raising a nocturnal animal. As no records exist on how to raise or train a watch-wher, Kindan has no clue but is luckily aided by the mysterious Nuella. Together, they train Kisk and, in the process, learn a great deal about this species. This proves to be vital as, towards the end of the novel, Kisk's abilities will save many lives, including that of the camp leader, Natalon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " Based on the parallels between the mathematical representations of paraxial diffraction and dispersion, the temporal imaging of optical pulses integrates linear dispersive filters with quadratic phase modulations that function as time lenses. We explore the programming of a dispersive filter situated near atomic resonance in crystals doped with rare earth ions, resulting in exceptionally high dispersive power values. This filter is employed in a simplified imaging approach, which merges a single time lens with a single dispersive section, acting as a time-reversing device, and holds potential for applications in radio-frequency signal processing. This approach is closely linked to the three-pulse photon echo involving chirped pulses, yet the relationship with temporal imaging and dispersive filtering highlights novel characteristics."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nBased on the similarity of paraxial diffraction and dispersion mathematical\ndescriptions, the temporal imaging of optical pulses combines linear dispersive\nfilters and quadratic phase modulations operating as time lenses.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nIn a market with incomplete information and a non-tradable random factor, we examine a continuous-time investment problem where the goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risk, based on a specific set of preferences. We model this problem as a stochastic differential game and use a set of equations known as Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equations to find the optimal investment strategy and a value function that represents the maximum return. Notably, our solution also applies to the traditional Markowitz problem, and we show that any optimal solution for the Markowitz problem is also optimal for our specific set of preferences. This is significant because the original Markowitz approach does not meet certain criteria, and previous studies have shown that the solutions to the Markowitz and our approach can differ in certain cases. Furthermore, we derive explicit investment strategies for a specific type of market model known as the square root factor model."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nWe consider an incomplete market with a nontradable stochastic factor and a\ncontinuous time investment problem with an optimality criterion based on\nmonotone mean-variance preferences.

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nIn Ireland, an ordinary referendum is a vote on a bill that does not aim to amend the Constitution. The Constitution outlines the process in Articles 27 (\"Reference of Bills to the People\") and 47 (\"The Referendum\"). Unlike a constitutional referendum, which is mandatory for a constitutional amendment bill, an ordinary referendum only occurs if the bill \"contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained.\" This decision is made by the President, after a petition by Oireachtas members, including a majority of Senators. No such petition has ever been presented, and thus no ordinary referendum has ever been held.\n\nOverview\nThe Oireachtas is a bicameral legislature in which the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the lower house, is much more powerful than the Seanad \u00c9ireann, the upper house. The Seanad cannot veto bills passed by the D\u00e1il; it can at most delay them for 90 days before they are deemed to have been passed. The ordinary referendum in theory allows the Seanad to exercise a check on the D\u00e1il by providing a mechanism for it to prevent the passing of a bill with which it disagrees. However, the composition of the Seanad, especially the fact that 11 of the 60 Senators are nominated by the Taoiseach, means that it usually has a pro-government majority and will not oppose a

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nRepublic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr expressed his disappointment that his team only managed to score one goal in their friendly win over Croatia. Robbie Keane's first-half goal, which marked his 24th Republic of Ireland goal, proved to be enough for the victory.

The Republic of Ireland side maintained a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and have now gone 14 home games unbeaten since Kerr took over from Mick McCarthy.\n\nKerr praised the decisive goal, which was scored by Robbie Keane, and credited Damien Duff for his brilliant play that led to the goal. \"It was a fantastic goal, and Damien's skill was outstanding,\" Kerr said. \"Robbie might have had a slight misstep, but it was still a great goal.\"\n\nMatchwinner Keane also praised Duff's role in the goal, saying, \"It was great play from Damien. I always try to be in the right position because I know that nine times out of ten, Duffer will get the ball into the box.\" Keane also appreciated the opportunity to play with three strikers, which was a new formation that Kerr wanted to try out. He was pleased to see young Stephen Elliott getting a run-out and doing well despite the difficult conditions.\n\nMan-of-the-match Duff explained what went wrong when he had a chance to make it 2-0 midway through the second half. He opted to shoot against the bar instead of heading the ball close-range, which he would have done every time. \"I completely lost it in the lights,\" Duff said. \"I was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself, but the result is the most important thing.\"\n\nDuff was pleased with the team's performance and the result, which has set them up nicely for the qualifiers. \"We've had a good year, and we're going nicely in the qualifiers,\" he said. \"Hopefully, we can continue this momentum in 2005.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nRepublic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over Croatia. \n\nRobbie Keane took his Republic record to 24 with a first-half goal which proved enough for victory. \"We had more good chances. \n\nIt is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team,\" said Kerr. \n\n\"But, given the conditions and the standard of the Croatian team, we should be very happy with the win.\" The Republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since Kerr succeeded Mick McCarthy.

If cooking on the stove top, place frozen meatballs in the oven and bake according to manufacturers' instructions. Typically 25 minutes at 350. Feel free to lightly season your meatballs any way you prefer before placing them in the oven. Add everything else except for bread, peppers, and cheeses in a large pot and simmer for 25 minutes. Add fully baked meatballs and simmer an additional 25 minutes. If your sauce tastes a bit too acidic due to the tomatoes, add 1/4 tsp Baking Soda to your simmering pot. Your sauce will foam up but no worries. Stir in, simmer again, then taste and add 1/4 tsp more if the acidic taste persists. Repeat if necessary. Toast your rolls but be careful not to fully split your bread through the middle. Place meatballs [leave whole or cut in half] and sauce on fresh sub bread. Top with Mozzarella and Parmesan Cheese; Provolone works well too, along with Banana Peppers or Sport Peppers. Serve with a side bottle of Tabasco.

[{"role": "user", "content": " To prepare a delicious spaghetti dish, start by gathering the necessary ingredients. You will need 400 grams of spaghetti, 75 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil, 1 clove of garlic, smashed and cut in half, 2 anchovies, finely chopped, 150 grams of black truffle, washed in tepid water and brushed with a medium firm brush until clean, then grated or pounded or jared black truffle paste, and sea salt.\n\nBegin by bringing 7 liters of water to a boil in a large pot with 3 tablespoons of salt. Place your spaghetti in the water and cook until the desired texture has been achieved (typically the cooking time indicated on the pasta packaging). Meanwhile, in a separate pan, fill the bottom with water and in the top pan place the olive oil, garlic, anchovy, and heat. Be careful not to fry the garlic but rather infuse the oil with its flavor. The anchovy should be fully dissolved when heated (about 5 minutes after the water starts to boil). Remove the garlic and discard. Add the truffle to the oil. Stir the truffle and oil with a fork to create an emulsion. Make sure not to boil this mixture. Stir for 5 minutes and then turn off the heat.\n\nDrain the pasta but not too much so that there is still plenty of water on the pasta. Add the pasta to the truffle emulsion. If the sauce is too thick, you can add spoonfuls of water one at a time, stirring to loosen the sauce. Stir until the pasta is evenly coated and then divide between 4 serving bowls.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nThe novel begins with Orleanna Price's narrative, which sets the tone for the story. The narrative then shifts to the four daughters - Adah, Leah, Rachel, and Ruth May - each with their unique voice and perspective. Leah's outspoken nature makes her voice stand out, while the others contribute to the story in their own way. As the girls mature, they develop different coping mechanisms for dealing with their father Nathan's strict and often misogynistic views, as well as the turmoil that grips the Congo in the 1960s. Initially, the Congolese villagers are portrayed as mysterious and unfamiliar, but as the girls grow, they begin to see the villagers as complex and multifaceted individuals with their own culture and traditions. However, Nathan's refusal to adapt to the local culture and his stubbornness ultimately lead to his family's isolation. It takes a series of tragic events, including the loss of one of the daughters, for the women to finally leave Nathan behind. The novel concludes with the surviving daughters embarking on different paths in life, with Rachel building a successful business, Leah raising a large family, Adah returning to the United States to pursue her education and medical career, and Orleanna finding solace in her life on the Georgian coast. The story comes full circle with Adah's visits to her mother, while the backdrop of the Congo's tumultuous history is marked by the passing of time, including the death of Mobutu Sese Seko in the 1990s."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nOrleanna Price narrates the introductory chapter in five of the novel's seven sections. The narrative then alternates among the four daughters, with a slight preference for the voice of the most outspoken one, Leah. The four girls increasingly mature, as each adapts differently to African village life, to the misogyny of their father Nathan, and the political turmoil that overtakes The Congo in the 1960s. Since the Congolese villagers are seen through the eyes of the growing daughters, the view changes. At first, they appear as ridiculous savages. But as the girls mature, the villagers become fully fleshed-out human beings, immersed in a complex and sophisticated culture. Nathan's lack of responsiveness to this culture wears out his family's welcome, but he refuses to leave. Only after a series of misfortunes&mdash;culminating in the death of one of the daughters&mdash;do the women leave Nathan Price to his folly. The survivors take different paths into their futures, the novel ending at the time of Mobutu Sese Seko's death in the 1990s. Rachel, the eldest, marries Axelroot at seventeen, and after two more marriages is the owner of a luxury hotel close to what is now Brazzaville. Leah marries Anatole, has a large family of four boys, and remains in the impoverished Congo. Adah returns to the United States with their mother Orleanna, attending college and later, medical school. She undergoes a lengthy experimental treatment that restores full use of her legs and she begins to speak. Orleanna herself returns to spending life on the Georgian coast, enjoying Adah's occasional visits."}]

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nTheodore Scott-Dabo, commonly known as Scott Dabo, was a French-American tonalist landscape artist born on November 16, 1865, and passed away on November 17, 1928. Initially thought to be from Detroit, Michigan, it is now known that he was born in Saverny, France. Active in both New York and Paris, he was the younger brother of Leon Dabo. Both artists were Impressionist landscape painters who shared a similar style and tone. When they worked together, their subjects typically featured landscapes and seascapes at twilight, utilizing sparse composition and reduced color schemes to evoke mood. The Dabo brothers' style, characterized by a Whistlerian quality, would later be labeled as Tonalist, much like James McNeill Whistler. The youngest brother, Louis, a writer and publicist, also used the name Scott Dabo. \n\nThe Dabo family lived in Detroit, Michigan, between 1870 and the early 1880s under the surname Scott. Both Theodore and his elder brother Leon received their initial artistic training from their father, Ignace Scott. Theodore's work, as well as that of his brother Leon, demonstrate the influence of James McNeill Whistler and J.M.W. Turner, whom the brothers discussed in their correspondence."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nT\u200bh\u200be\u200bo\u200bd\u200bo\u200br\u200be\u200b

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nLawrence VanKoughnet was a key figure in Canada's Department of Indian Affairs in the late 19th century. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the department, starting as a clerk with family connections to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. From chief civil servant to deputy superintendent, VanKoughnet achieved a great deal during his tenure. However, after a three-month sick leave due to a \"disordered nervous system,\" he struggled to regain his momentum. Despite this setback, VanKoughnet was noted by many historians to be the man who cut costs on the ratios the government supplied to the reserves. Despite only visiting the reserves once, where he was reluctant to socialize with the chiefs, VanKoughnet announced his change of policy plans in Battleford shortly afterwards: Indians would only be supplied with rations if they were unable to sustain themselves. As deputy superintendent of the Department of Indian Affairs, VanKoughnet's goal was to keep costs to a minimum. He believed that as long as they were supplying reserve people with rations, they would remain dependent on the government and therefore a significant burden to their expenses. The Department of Indian Affairs and the loss of the buffalo played a significant role in shaping VanKoughnet's policies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " A significant open question in the research of synchronization of coupled oscillators is to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to synchronize within a specified family of graphs. This is a challenging inquiry that necessitates a clear understanding of how the nonlinear interactions among local entities develop over the underlying graph. Another open question is to establish bounds on the time complexity of synchronization, which has crucial practical implications in clock synchronization algorithms. We address these inquiries for a one-parameter family of discrete pulse-coupled inhibitory oscillators known as the $kappa$-color firefly cellular automata (FCA). Specifically, we demonstrate that for $kappa \\le 6$, the recurrence of each oscillator is a necessary and sufficient condition for synchronization on finite trees, while for $kappa \\ge 7$, this condition is only necessary. Additionally, we show that any non-synchronizing dynamics for $kappa \\le 6$ on trees decompose into synchronized subtrees partitioned by 'dead' oscillators. Furthermore, on trees with diameter $d$ and maximum degree at most $kappa$, we establish that the worst-case number of iterations until synchronization is of order $O(kappa d)$ for $kappa \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$, $O(kappa d^{2})$ for $kappa=6$, and infinite for $kappa \\ge 7$. Lastly, we report simulation results of FCA on lattices and conjecture that on a finite square lattice, any arbitrary initial configuration is synchronized under $kappa$-color FCA if and only if

[{"role": "user", "content": " Well-intentioned, this film narrates the fictional tale of Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe), an American soldier who, after completing a heroic yet harrowing tour of duty in Iraq, is informed that, against his wishes, he must return to Iraq for additional combat duty due to a real-life contingency known as \"stop-loss.\" It\u2019s a fate that neither King nor real-life soldiers desire or deserve, yet the U.S. government justifies it in lieu of a wartime draft. \n\nThe film's opening minutes present a montage of images and scenes depicting King and his comrades in Iraq, as they bond together as protective buddies and endure a violent urban ambush, during which several of their friends are killed or seriously injured. \n\nBack home in Texas, King and a few of his men briefly celebrate their hero status. However, life for them quickly deteriorates, as their wartime trauma leaves both physical and mental scars. Then, King receives his \"stop-loss\" notice, setting the stage for the remainder of the film's plot. \n\nThe theme here is clear. The brave soldier, having faced more than enough danger and trauma, remains just a powerless individual. As such, he finds himself caught between having to resubmit to the horrors of war or submit to a perilous and life-altering AWOL status in the U.S., or elsewhere, forever on the run from an overpowering American political system. It\u2019s a timely and significant subject for a film. \n\nA great deal of effort and care went into the creation of the film, from background research to attention to detail in costumes, production design, and military protocol. \n\nAdditionally, the film's color cinematography is quite impressive. There are numerous close-ups that capture the characters' emotional experiences. Many scenes utilize natural lighting in clever ways. At times, the film has an almost documentary-like appearance and feel. The acting is generally credible. I particularly appreciated the performances of Linda Emond as King\u2019s mother and Abbie Cornish as a young woman who tries to assist King. \n\nThe main issue lies with the script. Characters are somewhat stereotyped and two-dimensional. The plot is fairly predictable. Moreover, the story and its accompanying theme are a tad too direct. I would have preferred a bit more depth, along with a plot twist or two. The film's ending is not very satisfying. \n\nYet, \"Stop-Loss\" is a commendable effort to document the brutality not only of war but also of an American government that uses, then essentially discards, people to ensure the preservation of an American war industry and the continued power of faceless bureaucrats and corrupt politicians."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nBuilding on the similarity between parallel differential and dispersion mathematical descriptions, the temporal imaging of optical pulses combines linear dispersive filters and quadratic phase modulations operating as time lenses. We consider programming a dispersive filter near atomic resonance in rare earth ion doped crystals, which leads to unprecedented high values of dispersive power. This filter is used in an approximate imaging scheme, combining a single time lens and a single dispersive section and operating as a time reversing device, with potential applications in radio-frequency signal processing. This scheme is closely related to three-pulse photon echo with chirped pulses but the connection with temporal imaging and dispersive filtering emphasizes new features."}, {"role": "assistant",

Former Special Branch agent Dominic Elder, driven by a long-standing obsession with a notorious female assassin known as Witch, is pulled back into the world of espionage to help unravel the mystery surrounding the boat's explosion. As it appears that Witch may be involved, she leaves behind a trail of subtle clues, hinting at her presence and warning Elder to stay away. However, this is only the beginning of the challenges that Special Branch will face if Elder's instincts are correct. With Witch's reputation for being one step ahead of her pursuers, the stakes are high, especially with a crucial summit of world leaders scheduled to take place in London. Young detective Michael Barclay's meticulous approach leads him to follow Witch's trail, with valuable assistance from his liaison in the French police, Dominique. As Michael develops feelings for Dominique, he must navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries between the detectives, MI5 agents, and the elusive Witch, who seems to be always one move ahead. The cat-and-mouse game between them unfolds across multiple countries, including Scotland, England, France, and even a brief visit to a former associate of Witch in prison in Germany."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nA fishing boat sinks in the English Channel in the middle of the night, and the evidence points to murder. Ex-Special Branch agent Dominic Elder comes out of retirement to help investigate the explosion of the boat, as it appears that his long-time obsession, a female assassin known as Witch, may be responsible. Using the boat to get to England from France, Witch left a subtle trail of clues to announce her arrival and to warn off Elder. But that is the least of Special Branch's worries, if Elder's well-honed intuition is correct. He has seen her work before and knows her to be a resourceful enemy, who always seems a step ahead of the authorities. With an imminent summit of world leaders to be held in London, Witch's target seems obvious. Young Michael Barclay's thoroughness leads him onto Witch's trail, with the help of his liaison in the French police, Dominique. Apart from her language help and guidance around Paris, Michael is sexually attracted to her. The team of detectives and MI5 agents, and the terrorist, play cat-and-mouse with each other in Scotland, England, France, and even briefly visit a former associate of Witch in prison in Germany."}]

I apologize for the delay.  \nThere are a few issues with the rentroll from 2/2.  \n1. I recall you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65, which aligns with what the bank indicates, but the rentroll totals only 4865. The discrepancy in the spreadsheet likely explains my other inquiries below.  \n2. #1 Did he pay the rent he owed from 1/26?  \n3. #3 Did he miss rent payments on 1/26 and 2/2?  \n4. #11 Was missed on 2/2?  \n5. #13 Was missed on 1/26?  \n6. #14 Was missed on 2/2?  \n7. #15 Was missed on 2/2 and has not settled the 95 from 1/19?  \n8. #20a Was missed on 2/2?  \n9. #35 Was missed on 2/2?  \nI suspect some of these payments were made but not reflected in the 2/2 rentroll. You might have sent me a message via the \"chat\" line that I don't recall regarding some of these.

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nThe European stock market, Euronext, has met with the London Stock Exchange (LSE) amid speculation that it may be ready to launch a cash bid. Euronext's chief, Jean-Francois Theodore, held talks with LSE boss Clara Furse the day after rival Deutsche Borse put forward its own bid case. The German exchange said it had held \"constructive, professional, and friendly\" talks with the LSE. However, Euronext declined to comment after the talks ended on Friday. Speculation is mounting that the Germans may raise their bid to \u00a31.5 billion. Deutsche Borse previously offered \u00a31.3 billion, which was rejected by the LSE, while Euronext is rumored to have facilities in place to fund a \u00a31.4 billion cash bid. So far, neither has tabled a formal bid. However, a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThere was speculation that Euronext would use Friday's meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing discontent over Deutsche Borse's own plans for dominance over the London market. Unions for Deutsche Borse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. \"The works council has expressed concerns that the equities and derivatives trade could be managed from London in the future,\" Reuters news agency reports a union source as saying. German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid is successful.\n\nMeanwhile, LSE shareholders fear that Deutsche Borse's control over its Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes security transactions - would create a monopoly situation. This would weaken the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. The LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive. The German group's ownership of Clearstream has been seen as the main stumbling block to a London-Frankfurt merger. Commentators believe Deutsche Borse, which has now formally asked German authorities to approve its plan to buy the LSE, may offer to sell Clearstream to gain shareholder approval. Euronext, so far, has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the LSE - Europe's biggest equity market - into a deal."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Remove from heat and let cool. Grind the toasted spices in a coffee grinder to a coarse salt consistency and pour into a small bowl. Add the garlic powder, salt, and curry powder and mix well. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Prick the skin of the duck all over with the point of a very sharp knife. Rub the duck with the spice mixture. Place in a roasting pan and roast for 20 minutes. Decrease the temperature to 350 degrees F and cook for another 40 minutes, until the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced. Transfer the duck to a platter, reserving the duck fat in the pan. When the duck cools, remove the skin and the meat and julienne both. Place the skin in a small saut\u00e9 pan. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved duck drippings and saut\u00e9 slowly over low heat. Cook for about 15 minutes, until the fat is rendered from the skin and the skin is crispy. Transfer to paper towels to drain.  \n\nFor the dressing: Place all the ingredients except the canola oil in a blender. Blend for 1 minute. With the motor running, slowly add the canola oil. If the dressing is too thick, add a small amount of water to thin it to desired consistency.  \n\nFor the salad: In a large bowl, mix the greens, carrot, jicama, green onion, cranberries, macadamia nuts, and mango. Drizzle with 3/4 cup of the dressing and toss to coat. To assemble the dish, divide the dressed greens among the tortillas and mound in the center. Divide the duck meat among the salads. Top with the wonton strips and duck skin cracklings and serve.  \n\n*Cook's Note: We suggest using Sriracha Thai-chili paste for a spicier dressing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

This concept is derived from the idea that there are three main estates in the UK: the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, and the House of Commons. However, the 'fourth estate' suggests that the press holds a significant amount of power, separate from these traditional institutions.\n\nAs noted by Akre, journalists often adhere to an unwritten rule that prohibits them from reporting on themselves or the media industry. This reluctance to self-examine is at the heart of the crisis facing the 'fourth estate', as it implies that no one is holding the press accountable for its actions.\n\nA wise English proverb reminds us that \"Write down the advice of him who loves you, though you like it not at present.\" In the context of language and communication, this means that the gift of words can be a powerful tool for self-improvement and growth.\n\nIf you'd like to give the gift of language to someone, consider subscribing them to A.Word.A.Day.

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nI was supposed to see either Flight or Argo today, but to my disappointment, I missed both showtimes, and I was in a tight time frame where I could see anything. So, my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.\n\nWreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant, and its action pieces are pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this glorious, colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how \"pretty\" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reilly, Silverman, McBride, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. \n\nOverall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectful manner, and the film hits greatness in writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kind of put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that stands out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it.

[{"role": "user", "content": " \n\nParmalat has taken legal action against 45 banks in an attempt to reclaim money paid to them before the Italian dairy company's collapse last year. The firm, which had debts of around 14 billion euros ($19 billion; \u00a310 billion), has already taken action against a number of lenders. Its new boss, Enrico Bondi, claims the banks were aware of the company's financial problems but continued to work with it in order to earn commissions. Parmalat has not identified which banks it is targeting this time. Under Italian law, administrators can seek to recover money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew the company was in trouble. The firm also said it is preparing further lawsuits.\n\nAccording to the Reuters news agency, 35 of the companies sued on Thursday are Italian while the remaining 10 are international. The unidentified Parmalat source also told Reuters that the company is planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions. Among those already targeted are Bank of America, UBS, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, and Citigroup. It has also gone after auditor Grant Thornton. They have all denied any wrongdoing. Parmalat was declared insolvent in December 2003 after it emerged that 4 billion euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not exist. In the investigation that followed, it became apparent that the company, among other things, had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet. That enabled Parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas, allowing it to become a darling of the Italian stock exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

[{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nAs I stand before the familiar landscape of my childhood home, a mix of emotions swirls within me. While the memories that flood my mind bring a sense of nostalgia, they also evoke a deep sadness. Memory, a realm that exists between the earthly and the divine, has the power to transform even the most painful experiences into something beautiful and pure. It's as if the shadows of the past are illuminated by a soft, ethereal light, revealing scenes that are both haunting and enchanting.\n\nJust as the twilight hours can be mesmerizing, and the distant sound of a waterfall can be hauntingly beautiful, memory has the ability to sanctify all that we've known and lost. Twenty years have passed since I last visited this place, and yet, the memories remain vivid. I'm reminded of the friends I left behind, and how time has changed them. Many have grown old, and some have even passed away. I hear the whispers of those who remain, speaking of the inevitability of death, and how it's a fate that none can escape.\n\nAs I wander through the empty rooms and fields, I'm struck by the sense of loss that pervades this place. I feel like a friend of the dead, walking among the tombs that hold the memories of those who've gone. But there's something even more haunting than the graves themselves \u2013 the human form that's been left behind, a shell of a person where the mind has fled. Poor Matthew, a brilliant and talented individual, now trapped in a world of madness, a wild and savage place where reason has been lost.\n\nI remember the day when Matthew first succumbed to his illness, and how it changed him forever. I recall the struggles he faced, the fear that gripped those around him, and the desperate attempts to contain his destructive strength. And even though time has passed, and the worst of his torment has subsided, the memories of his suffering remain. I've often heard his plaintive cries, like a distant knell, a reminder of the pain that he endured. And I've crept away to listen, stealing moments to hear the whispers of a mind that's been lost.\n\nThis is a past that's been left behind, a reminder of the fragility of the human mind. Matthew's piercing cries and sweet lullabies are now nothing more than a distant memory, a reminder of what's been lost. And yet, even in death, he remains a source of pain, a reminder of the terror that death inspires. O Death, why do you leave him lingering here, a shadow of a person that once was?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\nMy childhood's home I see again, and I am saddened by the sight; and still, while my memory fills my brain, there is a pleasure in it too. O memory! you middle-world 'twixt earth and paradise, where rotten things and people who are gone, rising from the shadows of sleep, are cleansed of all earthly blemishes, and, sanctified, pure and bright, appear like scenes from some enchanted isle, All bathed in liquid light. And as the dusky mountains charm our eye, When twilight drives away day; And as the bugles we hear are soon forgotten, In the distance far away; And as, leaving a great waterfall, we linger to listen to its roar, So memory will sanctify all that we have known and do not know any more. Twenty years have passed since I bowed my head to the memory of this home and those who lived here, and left a place where many things, but now few remain, of old, familiar things, yet, seeing them, my mind's eye summons up, The lost and departed. My friends of the past I left behind; How time has changed them since! Young childhood gray, And half the men are dead. I hear the beloved ones say How none could escape death, And all the things they see seem like knells and tombs. I roam the fields with a thoughtful step, I walk through the silent rooms, And feel, friend of the dead, I live in the tombs. But here's a thing more terrible Than all the grave contains, A human form, where the mind has fled, Where life is still left. Poor Matthew! a whirling genius, A child of fortune, Now locked in a mental night, A wild and savage madman. Poor Matthew! I have never forgotten When first you struck a blow of madness, And maimed your own self; And father fought you, and mother tried to kill you; When fear spread out the frightened neighbors, Who tried to bind your dangerous strength; And soon, a howling maniac, Your limbs were confined. How then you struggled, you shrieked, You bared your bones and sinews, How dreadful were the signs The torment in your brain. And when at last, though slow and bleak, Time hushed your cruel woes, How plaintive were your lamentations, In the silent night. I have heard them often, as in a dream, distant, shrill, sweet, a knell of reason. And I have stolen away to hear them, listened with stealth, before the sun climbed over the eastern hill. The air seemed still; the trees, by the spell, seemed the faces of mourning angels, whose tears fell in dewdrops on the ear of the listening earth. This is past, and there is no more, That once had raised you above the brutes. Your piercing cries, your sweet lullabies, Are muted for all eternity. Now farewell, you are the cause rather than the subject of woe. And all mental pain, by the gentle laws of time, has lost the power to know. O Death, thou terror of men, that holds the world in dread, Why dost thou leave him lingering here?"}]

[{"role": "user", "content": " To make a delicious sweet potato dish, start by peeling and quartering 5 large sweet potatoes. In a large pot, combine 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, 1 large onion that's been diced, 1 pound of bulk sweet Italian sausage, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 8 ounces of mushrooms that have been sliced, 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning, and 1 quarter of a half-and-half (or as needed). Add salt and ground black pepper to taste, and 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.\n\nPlace the sweet potatoes in the large pot and cover them with cold water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 6 to 8 minutes. Drain the water and allow the potatoes to steam dry for a minute or two. Puree the potatoes in a food processor or blender in batches until smooth. Return the pureed potatoes to the large pot.\n\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the onion in the hot oil until it's translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the sausage to the skillet and cook until it's completely browned, breaking it apart with the back of a wooden spoon as it cooks. Stir in the garlic, mushrooms, and Italian seasoning, and continue cooking until the mushrooms are tender, another 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then transfer the sausage mixture to the pot with the potatoes.\n\nPour the half-and-half over the mixture, stirring to mix. Allow the soup to slowly heat until hot and to your desired consistency. Garnish with Parmesan cheese to serve."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewritten:\n5\u200b \u200bs\u200bw\u200be\u200be\u200bt\u200b
